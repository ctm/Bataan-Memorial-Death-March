# Bataan Memorial Death March Training

This is my ([Cliff
Matthews](https://www.strava.com/athletes/58696205)) (aka [Young Lazy
deadhead](https://ctm.github.io/docs/yld/welcome.html)) collection of
training logs for the [Bataan Memorial Death
Marches](http://bataanmarch.com) (civilian heavy) that I've done in the
past as well as the one I'm doing on March 22nd, 2025.  

Although I did my first BMDM in 2010, I didn't start these logs until
[2017](2017.md), which is a shame, since my [best time
(4:39:45.185)](https://bataanmemorialdeathmarch.itsyourrace.com/Results/6574/2016/35464/1524)
was in 2016, although I came close in 2023 with
[4:41:03](https://bataanmemorialdeathmarch.itsyourrace.com/Results/6574/2023/115251/2017).

So, in addition to [2017](2017.md), the others that I've logged in the
past are [2018](2018.md), [2019](2019.md), [2020](2020.md),
[2021](2021.md), [2022](2022.md), [2023](2023.md) and [2024](2024.md).

We'll see if I can stick to my schedule for [2025](2025.md). It's going to
be one of my most challenging years due to my having moved in with my ninety-two
year old mother to be her minder.


## What is the BMDM?

The Bataan Memorial Death March is a tribute to the men and women who
defended the Philippines at the onset of World War II.  They suffered
greatly and many perished either during the defense, after they were
surrendered and were forced to march (having subsisted on quarter
rations prior to the start of the march), at the inhumane prison
camps, in the hell-ships that carried them to Japan or in the forced
labor thereafter.

A few of those men and women, now in their nineties (or more!), are
still alive.  In 1989, members of the Army ROTC Department at New
Mexico State University started an annual march to honor these
veterans.  The march has grown considerably since then and although it
was initially open only to military members, they began allowing
civilians early on.  These days, participation is about half and half.
For the record, I am a civilian, although my father was in the Air
Force and there's a good chance at least one of my daughters will
serve.

## Why do I do it?

I attended my first BMDM in 2010.  I knew that in principle it was a
good cause, but it wasn't until I heard the vets tell their histories
that I was hooked.

Although that first march took me seven and a half hours and beat the
heck out of me, I decided to return each year as long as the original
vets were still coming out.  I also decided to volunteer for search
and rescue (SAR) since I realized I met the physical requirements and
knew that SAR was a tiny way I could say thanks with more than a word
and a handshake.

In addition to honoring veterans, training for BMDM kept me fit for
SAR missions, although I have not been a formal SAR member since
December 31st, 2020 due to how covid affected my former SAR team.

## How do I train?

I was totally unprepared my first year.  I did only four practice
hikes, each with a 35 pound pack, each with an increasing distance.
My hikes were in sandy terrain, because I had read about the sand
pits, and I wore hiking boots.  That was not a heavy enough pack to
train with; that wasn't enough training days, and the surface was too
soft.  So, when I attended my first BMDM, my feet hurt quite a bit by
mile six.  I could barely walk the last several miles.

Some of my previous years' training plans and logs have the history of
how I got to where I am, but basically from mid November until mid
March, I'll be doing a speed run with my pack every Wednesday and a
Saturday pack run that will alternate between a flat run with
forty-pounds and a 5 mile up and 5 mile down thirty-five pound pack
run at the local mountain. Specifically, my flat run will be done on
the Bosque Bike Path and my mountain run will be done on La Luz.

In addition to those pack runs, roughly every other week I'll also be
doing a pack run incorporating twelve 75 second all-out
intervals in the middle.  Sometimes the total distance for that pack
run will be as short as 5.6 miles. Other times it might be 8.9,
12.2 or 15.5, depending on how I'm feeling, the weather and how much
time I feel I can afford on a Monday.

In addition to my pack runs, I will also run without my pack the
remaining days of the week except Sunday, when I might ride my bike
(or run without my pack or run with my pack).

### Weight Training?

I do not currently do any weight training except the body
weight core exercises that I do on Tuesday and Thursday.  It is quite
possible that I would benefit from weight training, but what I've been
doing seems to work, more or less, and doesn't require me to leave my
house.  So, this section is for completeness of documentation and is
absolutely not a suggestion that anyone else do the same thing.

#### Tuesday and Thursday Core

The following section is embarrassing, in that there's no science,
per-se to suggest that this particularly useful for anything, but in
2011, when I was training for the Pikes Peak Marathon, I read
[Training for the Ascent and Marathon on Pikes
Peak](https://www.amazon.com/Training-Ascent-Marathon-Pikes-Peak/dp/B000LUWO1C)
by Matt Carpenter and Jim Freim and&mdash;IIRC&mdash;the only three
body weight core exercises they both did were push-ups, sit-ups and
squats, so I started doing them figuring I'd add in other exercises
later&hellip; and of course I never did.

I start at 5:15 and swallow a double espresso, then do 100 sit-ups,
using a chair as a brace.  Yes, I realize people recommend against
sit-ups in general and bracing your feet in specific, but I've been
doing this for years and I'm a creature of habit. It takes me about
seven minutes to do all 100; I don't rush. I then start a timer
that I have set for four minutes.

I then get into push-up/plank position, and fairly rapidly lower and raise
myself one hundred times. On this set I do not go deep enough for them to
be actual push-ups; they're more of a moving plank. I do these to warm up
my push-up muscles and to practice counting to 100. Once again, click
the four minute timer.

Next, I do 100 unweighted squats, typically while skimming an article
or comments from [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/news), then
I start the timer.

The rest of my core exercise consists of "real" push-ups (they used to
be nose-to-ground, but when my daughter was required to do push-ups
the rules she had to do them in did not allow the body to contact the
ground, so I adopted that policy), each with a four minute rest in
between. My first set is typically (at least for now) 18 more than my
six successive sets will be. My final set is until exhaustion.

On Tuesday, December 26th, 2023, for example my real push-ups were:

61 at 5:40<br/>
43 at 5:44<br/>
43 at 5:49<br/>
43 at 5:53<br/>
43 at 5:58<br/>
43 at 6:02<br/>
43 at 6:07<br/>
44 at 6:11

So, in under an hour, I'm done with my core exercise for the day and since
I only do them two days a week, I'm also either done with half for the week
or done for the week. Yay!

FWIW, over the years, I've fallen off the core exercise bandwagon
several times, and part of that has been due to me not really thinking
it provides anything other than being a PITA. However, I _seem_ to do
better in my running and rucking when I'm doing my core, so eventually
my regime evolved to doing it at **exactly** 5:15am, but only on
Tuesdays and Thursdays.  I found I can keep to that schedule, but when
it used to float, I'd do them erratically and then get frustrated when
I got poor results.

#### 2016: Injured Wrist, no push-ups

To date, my fastest completion of the Bataan Memorial Death March was my
run in 2016, when I finished in [4:39:45.185 as first place
overall](https://bataanmemorialdeathmarch.itsyourrace.com/Results/6574/2016/35464/1524)
in the Civilian Male Heavy division.  In late September of 2015,
I had injured my left wrist and that prevented me from doing push-ups
during my 2016 BMDM training block.  I do **not** think that I ran faster
because I did no push-ups. I do, however, think that my upper body strength
is basically irrelevant to my ability to complete BMDM in the heavy (i.e.
ruck-requiring) division.

As a comparison to 2016, I was well on my way to a faster finishing
time in 2019 when one of the upright supports of my pack broke.  Were
it not for that equipment failure, I think I would have finished
significantly faster than I had in 2016. By the end of my 2019 BMDM
training block I was doing three sets of twenty-five push-ups.




## Is this training plan safe?

No.  If you run with a pack, you risk injury.  I have worked up to
this training plan over several years.  A plan of doing _two_ pack
workouts a week with _some_ running and/or cycling in between is
probably doable for anyone who has already run a marathon or two,
although the times, distances and weight should probably be lessened.

## Base building

In previous years, my BMDM training began in mid November.  I was not
happy with my performance @ BMDM in March of 2017, so that year I
started doing Wednesday pack runs in late August.  I also stopped
tapering and taking recovery days after most of my August through
November races.

So, in my off season, although I only run with my pack on Wednesdays,
I still typically run five other days of the week and bike (or run) on
Sundays.

## Non-pack Days

Up until my 2025 training block, during the week I do slow runs from
my house out to Albuquerque Academy, some distance around Albuquerque
Academy and back to my house.  On Sundays, in theory, I ride my bike.
How far I ride is dependent on weather, mood, how much time I want to
be out and to a lesser extent how beat up I am from my Saturday
activity.

For example, for the 2020-2021 training season, here were my non-pack days:

|Day|Activity|Amount|
|---|--------|------|
|Sunday|Bike Ride|30.5, 71 or 100 miles|
|every other Monday|Interval Training inside Slow Run|15.5 miles|
|Tuesday|Slow Run|15.5 miles|
|Thursday|Slow Run|15.5 miles|
|Friday|Slow Run|18.8 miles|

During my 2025 training block, however, I will not be doing much cardio on
non-pack days, because I'll be walking with mom and there are only so many
hours in the day.  That will result in allowing my body to rest more between
pack runs but it may not pound my body hard enough to be in peak racing
performance by race day.  Only one way to find out&hellip;

## Pack (and exception) days

In the following table, `speed` means as quickly as I can to minimize
the total time I spend. This year it may be about a 9:30 minute/mile
pace when running with my pack.  My speed during my non-pack races
(e.g., the Mt. Taylor Winter Quadrathlon) varies greatly.

`Race` is my race goal of 10:18 minute/mile.

`Mountain`: I'm running up and down a mountain and trying to minimize
my time.  I run the same mountain course every other weekend.  As my
fitness increases, so does my pace.  My record, in February 2016, was
a 14:15 minute/mile pace.

`Comfort`: I'll keep my HR between below 150bpm (typically 130bpm)
during the training or event.  I'm out there to have fun.

`Interval`: Interval training with my forty pound pack.  
The intervals themselves
are 12 all-outs of 75 seconds each, with 30 seconds of light running
as rest in between.

When I run from my house, I typically run over to Albuquerque Academy,
then run around it some distance before coming back.  As such, I
typically have to wait at a stoplight a couple of times or more and
it's hillier than the Bosque Bike path, which has neither stops nor
hills.

`Timed`: I aim to be on my feet a specific amount of time.  This is
not normally how I schedule an exercise, but it's a good compromise
when I am coming back after not having done a pack exercise in a while
or recovering from some other event.

### Packs

I started my 2023 season training using a Kelty Tioga 5500 my sister
and brother-in-law bought me after my previous one broke (on March
6th, 2021).  At some point, the bottom most horizontal tube broke and
I patched it with duct tape.  The duct tape held well, but I did not
want to risk one of the uprights breaking, so I bought a new pack and
began using it on Monday, February 6th, 2023.

So, it looks like my Tioga 5500s break every two years or so (2019,
2021).  That's disappointing, since the original one I had lasted much
longer and was used on a ton of search-and-rescue missions in addition
to training for and competing at BMDM. However, I realize that I'm an
outlier and that I push my equipment very hard.
