# 2026 Bataan Memorial Death March Training Log

I do this every year.  There's more info in [the top-level
README.md](README.md) (although some of it may be outdated, due to me
having less time than normal).  My goal for 2026 is to be competitive
at the [Bataan Memorial Death March](https://bataanmarch.com/) and to
continue inspiring others.

### I'm registered

Although I'm very disappointed that Mineral Hill is gone again from
the course, on December 24th, I registered for the Bataan Memorial
Death March 2026.

I now have enough cash, to get a plate carrier, but I have not
researched what is out there, so as of December 29th, I'm still
training with my Tioga 5500 Frankenruck. I hope to get a plate carrier
"soon" and to compete with it.  My biggest concern is that the hip
belt on my Tioga transfers a huge amount of weight to my hips and if I
go with a hip belt that merely stabilizes my pack, there will be quite
a few muscles to train.

At some point, I'll probably add some more to this page and perhaps
update the top-level README.md.

### Survivors

On July 15th, 2025, Valdemar DeHerrera died.  He was 105.  On August
15th, James Bollich turned 104. As far as I know, James is still
alive.  With Valdemar's death, James probably became the last living
survivor of the Bataan Death March. Valdemar was present at
BMDM 2023. James was one of two speakers at BMDM 2019 (the last in
person BMDM before the three year covid hiatus).

[^1]: Started with a 40.2 pound pack, but one of the gallon jugs of
    water in it sprang a leak and therefore my pack was dripping water
    by the time I returned, so I probably lost a pound or so by the
    end.

[^2]: Started with a 40.2 pound pack, but my replacement jug of water
sprung a leak. There's probably something pokey inside my pack.  I will
try to find some beans to use instead of water. My pack weighed 39.7 pounds at
the end. I actually weighed it.

[^3]: I forgot to bring my Vertix 2 watch up to 8808, so I used Strava on my
phone, which doesn't record my heart-rate. I also forgot my teeth, which made
operating the bite valve a little tricky and annoying.

[^4]: I had some time critical work that kept seeming like it was
almost done, so, although I took a break to feed Albie, I didn't take
a break to run intervals. I did, however, get the work done.

[^6]: I chose to take mom walking later rather than earlier, to increase our
chance of seeing Albie. That worked. When I got back, I wanted to get some
work done and I also found out that my sister's cold got into her lungs.  I've
been having trouble with mom, and I've also been tired and I've also had a
little junk in my lungs. My left shoulder is still a bit scabby and slightly
bruised from my pack run on Saturday, so the combination of those four things
was easily enough to convince me to skip pack intervals and general laziness
is why I didn't do non-pack intervals. Intervals are annoying.

[^7]: I believe I weighed my pack at 35.8 before I left for La Luz,
but it was a tricky day and I planned on doing the canonical weighing
of it after I returned. However, by the time I returned, mom was ready
to walk and I thought there was a chance we'd see Albie (the
roadrunner we feed), so I poured myself a beer and went walking with
mom, forgetting to weigh my pack.

[^8]: Conditions weren't _quite_ treacherous, but they did merit
prudence.  However, even if I had tried to go significantly faster,
the snow was deep enough that I wouldn't have been able to; I'd just
have risked turning an ankle.  I stopped a few times to mother-hen
various hikers I saw.  I no longer do search-and-rescue, but it was a
SAR-kind of day. After the overlook, there was only one set of
footprints continuing up the mountain and even that set predated the
most recent snow. When I got to the metal plate, I saw that the
footprints continued up "new" La Luz and not up "old" La Luz. Old La
Luz is the "winter" route. Anyway, I felt like I had useful
information to contribute to the hikers I saw who were contemplating
ascending beyond the plate.

[^9]: Got off to a late start in part to accommodate mom, but also to
allow me to work a bit before walking with mom. The upside is I got
some work done, the downside is it fragmented my day.  I still had a
fair amount of damage to my back and feet from my ill-fated 24 mile
training run, so I chose to be a big baby and skip intervals.

[^10]: Got off to a late start to accommodate mom.  It was a bit on the
cold side for her, but she had also had some trouble at 4am, so wanted
extra sleep.  My left foot still was giving me enough trouble that I
took 400mg of ibuprofen at 9:59, but of course it was about 10:30 by
the time it kicked in and by then I had simply given up on doing
intervals today.
