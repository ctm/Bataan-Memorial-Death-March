# 2026 Bataan Memorial Death March Training Log

I do this every year.  There's more info in [the top-level
README.md](README.md) (although some of it may be outdated, due to me
having less time than normal).  My goal for 2026 is to be competitive
at the [Bataan Memorial Death March](https://bataanmarch.com/) and to
continue inspiring others.

### I'm committed

I haven't yet registered for BMDM 2026 and I'm very disappointed that
Mineral Hill is gone again from the course, but I am going to train for
and compete in BMDM 2026, regardless.

If I can scrape up the cash, I'll try getting a plate carrier and
training and competing with it.

At some point, I'll probably add some more to this page and perhaps
update the top-level README.md.

### Survivors

On July 15th, 2025, Valdemar DeHerrera died.  He was 105.  On August
15th, James Bollich turned 104. As far as I know, James is still
alive.  With Valdemar's death, James probably became the last living
survivor of the Bataan Death March. Valdemar was present at
BMDM 2023. James was one of two speakers at BMDM 2019 (the last in
person BMDM before the three year covid hiatus).
