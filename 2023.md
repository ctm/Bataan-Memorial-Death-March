# 2023 Bataan Memorial Death March Training Log

I mostly do this every year.  There's more info in [the top-level
README.md](README.md).  My goal for 2023 is to compete in various ruck
events and try to take first overall in each, even though I'll be
sixty years old. [My tentative
schedule](https://ctm.github.io/docs/yld/running/upcoming.html)
includes many events.  I'll be racing the ruck ones, but mostly just
having fun in the others.

### Warm-up

A month and a half before I will turn 60, [I
ran](https://www.webscorer.com/racedetails?raceid=293591&did=350019&cid=1738637&gender=M)
the [Feral Hog
50k](http://www.feraladventures.com/challenges/feral-hog-50k/) in the
ruck division as a test. It was the first time I've competitively
rucked at a distance longer than a marathon.  It also has a bunch of
elevation change. On the other hand, it was relatively cool and rainy
and my ruck only weighed about twenty four pounds, so I didn't beat
myself up much. OTOH, it was at the end of the [Albuquerque
International Balloon Fiesta](https://balloonfiesta.com/) and I
definitely lost fitness that week (/me makes the lifting-a-pint-glass
motion).

## Cocodona 250 Takes a Backseat in 2023

Last year, with the Bataan Memorial Death March not being held in
person, I half-assedly trained. At the culmination of my training, I
did a substitute run.  Since I knew that I was training for a
substitute, I deliberately modified my training to prioritize
adaptations to allow me to finish the Cocodona 250, an early May race.

I did indeed finish the Cocodona 250 in 2022, but it was an easier
course than normal (due to a last minute reroute to avoid a foret
fire). As such, I plan on doing the Cocodona 250 again in 2023, but I
am going to prioritize my rucking over my C250 training and just
assume I'll have sufficient fitness to finish C250 w/o trouble.

### Planned

#### Subject to Change

I will do most of the trainings in this table, but many of them are
scheduled around other events that have not yet been announced.  As
such, some of those events may be held on different days or may not be
held at all.

My basic plan of doing a speed run every Wednesday, doing interval
pack training every other Monday and alternating between Bosque Bike
Path pack runs and La Luz pack runs on Saturday is unlikely to change.

### Completed

I've done a bunch of maintenance ruck work since the 2022 substitute
BMDM event.  I log all my events to
[Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/58696205), but I didn't
create line entries in this file (or my [one for
2022](https://github.com/ctm/Bataan-Memorial-Death-March/blob/master/2022.md)).
