# Bataan Memorial Death March and Tough Ruck training

My (Cliff Matthews) training plan and log for either the 2021 [Bataan
Memorial Death March](http://bataanmarch.com) (civilian heavy) or a
substitute to be held on the same day in Albuquerque.  This is similar
to what I did for [2017](2017.md), [2018](2018.md) and
[2019](2019.md).

## What is the BMDM?

The Bataan Memorial Death March is a tribute to the men and women who
defended the Philippines at the onset of World War II.  They suffered
greatly and many perished either during the defense, after they were
surrendered and were forced to march (having subsisted on quarter
rations prior to the start of the march), at the inhumane prison
camps, the hell-ships that carried them to Japan or in the forced
labor thereafter.

Some of those men and women, now in their nineties (or more!), are
still alive.  In 1989, members of the Army ROTC Department at New
Mexico State University started an annual march to honor these
veterans.  The march has grown considerably since then and although it
was initially open only to military members, they began allowing
civilians early on.  These days, participation is about half and half.
For the record, I am a civilian, although my father was in the Air
Force and there's a good chance at least one of my daughters will
serve.

## Why do I do it?

I attended my first BMDM in 2010.  I knew that in principle it was a
good cause, but it wasn't until I heard the vets tell their histories
that I was hooked.

Although that first march took me seven and a half hours and beat the
heck out of me, I decided to return each year as long as the original
vets were still coming out.  I also decided to volunteer for search
and rescue (SAR) since I realized I met the physical requirements and
knew that SAR was a tiny way I could say thanks with more than a word
and a handshake.

In addition to honoring veterans, training for BMDM keeps me fit for
SAR missions.

## How do I train?

I was totally unprepared my first year.  I did only four practice
hikes, each with a 35 pound pack, each with an increasing distance.
My hikes were in sandy terrain, because I had read about the sand
pits, and I wore hiking boots.  That was not a heavy enough pack to
train with; that wasn't enough training days, and the surface was too
soft.  So, when I attended my first BMDM, my feet hurt quite a bit by
mile six.  I could barely walk the last several miles.

Some of my previous years' training plans and logs have the history of
how I got to where I am, but basically from mid November 2020 until
March 21st, I'll be doing a speed run with my pack every Wednesday and
a Saturday pack run that will alternate between a flat run with
forty-pounds and a 5 mile up and 5 mile down thirty-five pound pack
run at the local mountain. Specifically, my flat run will be done on
the Bosque Bike Path and my mountain run will be done on La Luz.

In addition to those pack runs, roughly every other week I'll also be
doing a 13.1 mile pack run incorporating 12 75 second all-out
intervals in the middle.

In addition to my pack runs, I will also run without my pack the
remaining days of the week except Sunday, when I might ride my bike
(or run without my pack or run with my pack).

## Is this training plan safe?

No.  If you run with a pack, you risk injury.  I have worked up to
this training plan over several years.  A plan of doing _two_ pack
workouts a week with _some_ running and/or cycling in between is
probably doable for anyone who has already run a marathon or two,
although the times, distances and weight should probably be lessened.

## Base building

In previous years, my BMDM training has begun in mid November.  I was
not happy with my performance @ BMDM in March of 2017, so that year I
started doing Wednesday pack runs in late August.  I also stopped
tapering and taking recovery days after my August through November
races.

So, in my off season, although I only run with my pack on Wednesdays,
I still typically run five other days of the week and bike (or run) on
Sundays.


## Non-pack Days

During the week I do slow runs from my house out to Albuquerque
Academy, some distance around Albuquerque Academy and back to my
house.  On Sundays I ride my bike.  How far I ride is dependent on
weather, mood, how much time I want to be out and to a lesser extent
how beat up I am from my Saturday activity. I usually ride my bike
between an hour to an hour and a half the day after a La Luz pack run
and an hour the day after a Bosque Bike Path pack run.

On Mondays I run from my house to Albuquerque Academy, run three laps
around AA, back to my house and then do another .9 miles to bring the
total up to 13.1 miles. However, during that half marathon, I do
twelve all-outs of seventy-five seconds with only thirty seconds of
rest in between.  I alternate between doing my Monday run with a 40
pound pack and without a pack.

In theory, I try to keep my heart-rate at about 130bpm for my slow
runs and bike ride, but if it's chilly or I'm rushed or otherwise
feeling frisky I may run, or bike, a bit faster.

So, for the 2020-2021 training season, here are my non-pack days:

|Day|Activity|Amount|
|---|--------|------|
|Sunday|Bike Ride|hour to hour and a half|
|every other Monday|1/2 marathon incorporating Interval Training|13.1 miles|
|Tuesday|Slow Run|8.9 miles|
|Thursday|Slow Run|8.9 miles|
|Friday|Slow Run|13.1 miles|

## Pack (and exception) days

In the following table, `speed` means as quickly as I can to minimize
the total time I spend. This year it may be about a 9:30 minute/mile
pace when running with my pack.  My speed during my non-pack races
(e.g., the Mt. Taylor Winter Quadrathlon) varies greatly.

`Race` is my race goal of 10:18 minute/mile.

`Mountain`: I'm running up and down a mountain and trying to minimize
my time.  I run the same mountain course every other weekend.  As my
fitness increases, so does my pace.  My record, in February 2016, was
a 14:15 minute/mile pace.

`Comfort`: I'll keep my HR between below 150bpm (typically 130bpm)
during the training or event.  I'm out there to have fun.

`Interval`: Interval training with my forty pound pack, wrapped with
enough low heart rate running on either end to be a total of 13.1
miles with an average heart rate of 130bpm.  The intervals themselves
are 12 all-outs of 75 seconds each, with 30 seconds of light running
as rest in between.

When I run from my house, I typically run over to Albuquerque Academy,
then run around it some distance before coming back.  As such, I
typically have to wait at a stoplight a couple of times or more and
it's hillier than the Bosque Bike path, which has neither stops nor
hills.

### Completed

FWIW, in previous years I've included various races that I've done
without my pack.  Due to covid, my race schedule was pretty erratic.
Any race that was a marathon or longer shows up on [my Marathon
Maniacs
page](https://www.marathonmaniacsdb.com/Maniacs/MyRaces?ManiacId=4395)
and most of my ultras how up on [my UltraSignup page](http://ultrasignup.com/results_participant.aspx?fname=Clifford&lname=Matthews).

### Packs

Since late January 2020, I've trained with a (brand new at the time)
Kelty Tioga 5500, after breaking the clip on my Osprey
search-and-rescue pack.
