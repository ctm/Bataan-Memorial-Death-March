# Bataan Memorial Death March training

Cliff Matthews's training log for the [2017 Bataan
Memorial Death March](http://bataanmarch.com) (civilian heavy).

## Bike Accident

On Sunday, January 8th, I was leisurely riding my bike on little sleep.
I had participated in a search and rescue mission the night before and
didn't get to sleep until 2:30am.  I got up at 6:30am and decided to go
ride my bike for 35 - 50 miles, thinking "Sure I'm tired, but how much
sleep do you need to ride a bike?".  Oops.

I was pedaling downhill toward the underpass under Paseo del Norte when
I realized that the dark stuff I was approaching wasn't _liquid_ water,
but black ice.  The next thing I remembered was someone helping me put
the chain back on my bike so I could ride back to my truck and get help.
Although I don't remember it, circumstantial evidence shows that I went
over the handlebars, landing on my face.  I chipped/broke 5 teeth and
was at the hospital for several hours before they sutured me up (one of my
punctures went completely through my chin and into my mouth).

My accident caused me to miss a week of training, and even after that
week, I had regressed.  Additionally, the Sandia Snowshoe
Race, which had been scheduled for January 21st got postponed due to weather.
So, I ran 21 miles with my pack on the 21st and did the Snowshoe Race
on the 28th.  I also changed my La Luz run on February 4th to a 24
mile pack run.

I was not meeting my goals before the accident, so it is unlikely that
I'll make my goal on race day.  I should break five hours (11:27
min/mile), but probably won't break four and a half (10:18 min/mile).


## Illness

I managed to catch a cold sometime after the Sandia Snowshoe race,
probably due to my celebratory drinking.  The cold I caught was pretty
virulent; my whole family came down with it.  It was
hard to shake, in part because I did both my Wednesday, February 1st,
pack run and the following Saturday pack run even though I had stuff
in my lungs.  The wheels fell off on my Saturday run, so not only did
I skip my Wednesday, February 8th pack run, but I ran a "5k" (the
course was really closer to 2.8 miles) on Saturday the 11th instead
of doing my normal La Luz Trail run.  By the time of the Mt. Taylor
Winter Quadrathlon I was 100% healthy again, but significantly slower
than last year due to all the training I had missed from the accident,
bad weather and sickness.

On November 26th, 2016, [John
Mims](https://www.af.mil/News/Article/109278/bataan-survivor-helps-celebrate-memorial-walk/),
a man many past participants of BMDM had the privilege of listening to,
[died](http://www.thepilot.com/news/hardship-cruelty-didn-t-blacken-john-mims-heart/article_02d8ab40-b56e-11e6-931e-87ffe1798689.html). Mims
didn't get punched in the mouth. On the real Bataan Death March, he
had picked up the empty coke bottle that a Japanese soldier had
dropped and handed it back to the soldier.  The soldier then smashed
the bottle against Mims's face, knocking out several of his teeth.  So
yeah, I fell off my bike and had to take a little time off from
training, but in the grand scheme of things, it was but a minor
annoyance.

Mentally, I hadn't completely recovered from my bike accident on race
day. I ran well all the way to, up and around Mineral Hill.  I came
flying down the road, but when I hit the uphill portion I did some
walking where I should have run.  It was very hot and I was so far off
my goal pace that I simply took my foot off the gas pedal for a little
while.

In 2014, 2015 and
[2016](http://www.itsyourrace.com/Results/6574/2016/35464/1524), using
basically the same training program, I was lucky enough to have come
in first.  In addition to the bike accident, I think I lost time in 2017
due to my switching from an external frame pack to an internal frame.  I
did that because an internal frame pack is better for search and rescue
although&mdash;in my opinion&mdash;it doesn't do as good of a job shedding
heat.  I made the decision to use the internal frame pack back in October
of 2016.  I had no way of knowing that BMDM 2017 would be the hottest it's
ever been since they moved it from April to March (long before I started
participating).
