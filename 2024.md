# 2024 Bataan Memorial Death March Training Log

I do this every year.  There's more info in [the top-level
README.md](README.md).  My goal for 2024 was to have beeen competitive
at the [Bataan Memorial Death March](https://bataanmarch.com/) (but
probably _not_ the [Tough Ruck](https://www.toughruck.org/), due to
work / finances).


### Cold Start

Normally I do a little rucking throughout the year to maintain my ruck
fitness.  However, I had a lot of trouble with my right foot during
training for BMDM 2023 and yet I continued to do many long distance
events, including the [Cocodona
250](https://ultrasignup.com/results_event.aspx?did=95982#id220546),
[Jemez Mountain Trail 50
miler](https://ultrasignup.com/results_event.aspx?did=96904#id220546)
(DFL) and the [Western States Endurance
Run](https://ultrasignup.com/results_event.aspx?did=97204#id220546).
After that, I took time off and didn't run at all, much less
ruck. Additionally, on July 1st I fell and cracked a rib which
also prevented me from rucking.

So, although I [raced the Tatonka
5k](https://ctm.github.io/docs/yld/running/past/2023/tatonka_5k.html)
with my ruck, I started my BMDM training in the worst shape
I've been in for years. By the end of my training block, however, I was
within spitting distance (and possibly slightly past) my fitness level
from 2023.

### Sunday was to have been cycling day

The following tables include all my planned rucks as well the named
non-rucking events I do during this training block.  I add those since
I schedule my rucking around them.  I don't list all the other
non-ruck running I do, but in general&mdash;at least in theory&mdash;I
was running six days a week and riding my unicycle[^9] or bicycle on
Sunday. In reality, I largely stopped unicycling by early December and
didn't get back on my bike much and toward the very end of this
training block I wasn't even running six days a week.

### Troublesome right foot

My right foot continues to give me trouble, but not as much as last
year.  Last year I had a cortisone shot the day before King of the
Hill and another about ten days before Western States.  I was also
using a fair amount of ibuprofen along with some acetaminophen an
lidocaine based foot pain relief.  This year I've had no cortisone or
lidocaine and around my usual complement of ibuprofen and
acetaminophen.

### Know your opposition (or suffer the consequences)

I finished fourth overall in male civilian heavy, but seven military
heavy men beat me as well. I did not start in front of the Wounded
Warriors due to me misremembering where we were supposed to start and
there not being a banner for runners.  Oops.  That _may_ have cost me
a spot of rank or two.

I did know that [Josh
Foster](https://bataanmemorialdeathmarch.itsyourrace.com/Results/6574/2023/115251/1849)
was back again this year and I mistakenly thought he was the
competition because in the bad old days it was&mdash;I
believe&mdash;fairly rare for someone to take first place on their
first attempt, since the course takes people by surprise.  However,
more people are doing ruck races than ever and there's a fair amount
of BMDM-specific info available (e.g. other people's Strava records),
so new people can and do take first.

Speaking of taking first, Jarrett Newby, who took first in male
civilian heavy this year, did so in
[3:24:51](https://bataanmemorialdeathmarch.itsyourrace.com/Results/6574/2024/124140/2388)
which was just eleven seconds slower than Henry Obrien's [3:24:40
first place in male civilian
**light**](https://bataanmemorialdeathmarch.itsyourrace.com/Results/6574/2024/124141/3382). I've never seen that before.  It also means I had absolutely no
chance for first this year.

I do think I was sufficiently fit to have shaved a few minutes off my time and
perhaps moved up a rank or two.  In addition to not knowing my opponents, I
paused my iPod touch during the opening ceremonies and the external battery
that is needed to drive it past mile fourteen turned itself off without me
knowing it, so I was tuneless for about half of the race.

This was the first time I stayed on base. I thought that would give me
a leg up and I definitely got more sleep, but it also gave me a chance
to try my ice hat, which is a big win for the Javelina Jundred, but I
think was a net lose for BMDM.

I also think I took too much ibuprofen and acetaminophen.  I woke up
with enough discomfort with my right foot that I took 400mg of
ibuprofen instead of 200 and then wound up taking another 400 mg of
ibuprofen and 500 mg acetaminophen around the half way point, even
though my foot wasn't chirping much at the time.  This was before my
tunes cut out.

I know that analgesics reduce my drive to run, but I figured that was
OK, because I could slow down a little and have some gas in the tank
were Joshua to catch up with me.  Turns out, he blew up and DNF'd, but
I did get passed twice, and didn't have much gas in the tank after
all.  Although I finished the last two miles faster than I have in a
long time (at least since 2019), the damage was done and I simply had
given up too much time elsewhere and my opponents were moving faster.

AFAIK, I was the first person to finish the full course with a pack
substantially full of food.  I am absolutely not disparaging the
people who use plate carriers.  Back when I did search and rescue, it
made sense for me to use a bulky pack and to carry food, but I've been
out of SAR since January 1st, 2021 and it's only a lack of money (and
to a lesser extent time and knowledge) that has prevented me from
using one.

There's always next year.

[^9]: I had hoped to enter the lottery for the [White Mountains
100](https://wm100.endurancenorth.org/) for 2024, but my finances did not
permit that. I am still training on my unicycle with an eye toward 2025.
[^1]: There was no ruck division, but I ran with my ruck anyway.
[^2]: This was **not** comfortable. Having run the Javelina Jundred on Saturday,
this was an experiment to see what six miles with a forty pound pack would
feel like. I figured I could always slow down and/or turn around early if
it was too uncomfortable.  Well, a little bit past the turnaround point it
was indeed "too" uncomfortable, but I still had to get home. D'oh!
[^3]: This **was** comfortable. I think I've got my right foot issue corrected.
I'll know for sure on December 2nd, when I do a 15 miler 40# ruck run at
race pace.
[^4]: I chose to run this event with my pack just to get a little extra training.
[^5]: GI distress caused me to turn around early and run toward the
toilet at home. Eventually I had to slow to a walk, so I've split
today's run into two portions: running and walking.
[^6]: I added this pack run to make up for my missing pack mileage from my
aborted speed run. I chose to do this at a 130bpm HR though because I have an
actual (non-pack) race later in the day.
[^7]: I'm doing a leisurely 5k ruck run on Sundays as part of the
    [Black Friday to White Christmas 5k
    Challenge](https://www.facebook.com/events/981971503034313)
[^8]: Initially I had penned in the [Tucson
Marathon](https://www.tucsonmarathon.com/) for today's training, but I
couldn't afford the time off from work for the drive there and back
and I was also having some knee and foot discomfort, so I chose to do
a mountain run instead. However, it was colder at the start than I had
prepared for and wound up wearing my puffy jacket without my ice hat
which, combined with the old rutted, yet frozen, snow caused me to go
ridiculously slowly.
[^10]: The scab on my back needed additional time to heal, and I also
wanted to run the [southern half of the Foothils 50k
course](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/map/foothills-fat-ass-50k-southern-section-5c3b99e)
to capture a clean GPX file.
[^11]: Today's conditions were treacherous. I chose to turn back at the overlook, even though I could have proceeded a little further before I would have hit the snowdrift that I shouldn't cross. As it is, I post-holed to just below my knees on the way up and below my knees on the way down.
[^12]: I was not feeling well, but I still got my pack ready, filled my handhelds, even "taped" my back, but then&mdash;at the last minute&mdash;chose to skip this training in part due to the GI distress that was accompanying my body aches, headache, congestion and stuff in my lungs. It was a tough call and I'm not convinced I made the right choice, but I'll never know.
[^13]: Initially scheduled for Wednesday, January 31st, but delayed a day so I
could try out my new orthotics.
[^14]: This should have been a speed run, but I started the morning
with a ton of junk in my lungs. Still, I decided to run the distance
anyway, just slower. Turns out I also had a sore left hamstring (I'm guessing
I minory injured it during my post-run stretch on Sunday) and wound up with
GI distress. But wait! There's more: since I already wasn't running quickly,
I didn't try hard to make it through the lights going into the main entrance
of Albuquerque Academy and since my right foot was chirping (probably from
residual damage I took on Sunday), I walked a bunch. FWIW, I think the new
orthotics are a win, but it may take a while for me to be sure.
[^15]: Hike with my sister on her 64th birthday, along with my brother-in-law.
We stopped at [Kaufman's Coffee & Bagels](https://kaufmanscoffeebagels.com/),
so I split our hike into two Strava activities.

[^16]: Had 41 pounds instead of 35, because I expected the snow to be
deeper and more dangerous than it had been on January 13th. I thought it
had been snowing a bunch in the mountains yesterday, but I was
mistaken. Anyway, my plan was to not train today, but to just to scout
out a training for tomorrow. That way I could prepare properly. It
turned out I was able to go all the way to the _plastic_ plate, which
is a little past the metal plate. The metal plate was buried, I
think. I didn't see it. My slowness was not due to the snow
conditions; see my [Strava
activity](https://www.strava.com/activities/10689297629) for more
info.

[^17]: Ruck with my buddy George and the [BFit505 Ruck Club](https://sites.google.com/view/bfit505/bataan-memorial-death-march-training)

[^18]: Yes, the temperature dropped 6.7F during my run. There was also a lot of
wind during part of it, as well as thunder hail and light rain. Althougn the
weather slowed me down some, my lungs probably held me back the most, followed
by my right foot, then the heat and only after that the wind.

[^19]: Left house in a minor rush because I wanted to crush my final
"full-distance" La Luz training run of the 2024 BMDM season, only to
find that one of my uprights had broken. So, I drove home and decided
to run around Albuquerque Academy with the broken upright, figuring
that if I felt the pack pulling too much to one side that I'd just
walk home.  That was the caffeine talking.  As I was running up
Harper, I remembered just how completely destroyed I was at the end of
BMDM 2019 when one of my uprights broke _during_ the race.  I realized
I should just head home ASAP, _before_ fucking up my body.  Duh.

[^20]: The snowdrifts became dangerous and although I&mdash;perhaps
foolishly&mdash;went past the overlook, I didn't quite make it to
where the metal plate would be. As it is, I went past any recent
footprints and was postholing into some powder that would be excellent
for skiing but not for hiking / running with a pack.

[^21]: My official goal was an average of 10:18 min/mile, but I knew
I'd be disappointed if I ran a ten minute mile or slower,
but&hellip; I was at the dentist yesterday. My Strava write-up has more
details.
