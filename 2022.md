# 2022 ~~Bataan Memorial Death March~~ Tough Ruck training log

I mostly do this every year.  There's more info in [the top-level
README.md](README.md). This year has been especially weird though both
due to me getting sick twice and some trouble with my right knee and
then later my left foot.

On top of my little ya-yas, although the Bataan Memorial Death March
has reverted to a virtual event once again, _in theory_, the [Tough
Ruck Boston](https://runsignup.com/Race/Info/MA/Concord/toughruck)
will be held on Saturday April 16th.  I only received the news on
February 5th, so I have not yet adjusted my calendar to stretch things
out, but I'll do that in the next few days.

Whee!

## Cocodona 250 Takes Priority

Although I have not yet signed up for it, I'm mentally committed to running
the Cocodona 250 on May 2nd. Additionally, I won't be running the official
Bataan Memorial Death March this year, although I do plan to help set up
aid stations so people in Albuquerque who are so inclined can either do the
virtual BMDM or simply do a free substitute that same day.

Due to BMDM not being available again this year, I'm altering my
training slightly. Whenever there's a potential trade-off between BMDM
performance and Cocodona performance, I'm opting for the latter.

An example of this is participating in the Academy of Pain run on
January 15th. In a normal training year I would not do a twelve hour
non-pack run in the middle of January. However, doing it _this year_
made sense, although my premature celebratory drinking resulted in me
missing a lot of training due to having gotten sick the day after.

*Covid: My wife tested positive for covid and I've had most of her
symptoms, but much milder (and _her_ symptoms are around what someone
with a bad cold or a light flu would have).  So, I haven't been doing
my normal exercises this week (in part due to a minor foot and a minor
knee injury) and will stay away from people for a while.  My decision
to not do my December 11th mountain pack run was due to the very
slight possibility that I would fall and hurt myself and require
assistance on a very cold day. IOW, I was feeling sufficiently well to
run it, but chose not to due to an over abundance of caution.

I was planning on doing my pack interval training on Monday, December
13th, but some minor family stuff that was covid related (but not
actual illness on my part) got in the way, which is probably just as
well since it gave my back, foot and knee a little more time to heal.

**On December 25th, my initial plan was to go and do my pack run early,
but I wasn't feeling 100% and started working in the morning.  It then
got late enough that if I had gone out to run I'd miss my immediate
family members' celebration, so I decided to do the pack run the
following day, but I wound up drinking from about 1pm to about 8pm
Christmas day and decided not to do the mountain run on Sunday when I
was going to be doing intervals with my pack the following day.

Then, the following day I _still_ wasn't feeling 100%, but I did get
ready to do my pack intervals until I realized the lowest curved tube
that connects my two external frame uprights was broken.  This is a
new place for my Tioga to break.  I've had one or more uprights break
on two different occasions and both times resulted in debilitating
pain for me, so I chose not to do about three hours, even though the
break didn't appear to have the same structural ramifications.

***On January 15th, I (foolishly, in retrospect) chose to celebrate 50
miles by drinking a 16 oz. 12.9% ABV Barrel-Aged Narwhal while walking
my fifteenth lap. That felt so good and there was so much time left
that I then walked another lap drinking a 16 oz. 7.5% Malpais Stout. I
felt great when I finished, but got pretty sick on Sunday and the
body-ache (and attendant loss of sleep) and junk in my lungs persisted
for over a week. Live and learn.

Although I participated in both the Sandia Snowshoe Race and the
Albuquerque Road Runners Resolutions Stink! race, I deliberately went
much slower than normal due to still being in recovery.  I skipped
running entirely on Monday and Tuesday, January 24th and 25th.  On
Wednesday the 26th, I did my scheduled 11 mile, 40 pound pack run, but
at a "comfortable" pace.  It turns out it was anything but comfortable
toward the end. I had body aches and it was not at all pleasant.

****Sometime in the last few days before February 5th, my left foot
started giving me trouble.  I could feel it on my 18.8 mile run on
Friday the 4th, but it wasn't that bad.

On Saturday, February 5th I planned on doing the first of my two 24
mile 40 pound rucks to make up for not doing it a week ago, so I had
400 mg of ibuprofen with my pre-run oatmeal.  However, my left foot
was still complaining an hour later and I got the good news that the
Tough Ruck Boston 2022 is going to be held on April 16th.  That means
I don't want to peak on March 20th, I want to peak on April 16th.

As such, babying my left foot now and stretching out my training plan
is the thing to do, so I chose to run from my house out to Albuquerque
Academy and then play it by ear.  At one point I ran into Rosie and
started walking with her so we could chat.  Once I started walking, my
left foot started chirping again, so I chose to continue walking until
I had done 12 miles, which is the distance I had scheduled for
Wednesday February 9th.  *If* my foot is up to it, perhaps I'll do the
24 miles on the 9th.

Turns out my foot was sufficiently beaten up by The Quad that I stayed
off of it until the V Day race, where my foot was not my limiting factor.
My weight gain and loss of fitness did hold me back.  The following day
I went on a three mile hike and my foot was complaining the entire time,
so I stayed off it until King of the Hill.  There too my foot was not
my limiting factor, just my weight gain and my lack of fitness.

*****Decided to do fasted, no ice hat, no panty-liner and to go faster
than a comfortable pace, but not even race pace, much less an actual
speed pace.  HRM wasn't working well enough to estimate my bpm.
