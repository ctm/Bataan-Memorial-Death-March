It's too early to set up my training schedule for 2020, but I'm
logging my body fat percentages, ruck runs, races and a few key
training runs.

|Test Date|Body Weight|Fat Weight|Fat Free Weight|Body Fat %|
|---------|-----------|----------|---------------|----------|
|2018-03-29|185.5|40.7|144.8|21.95|
|2018-06-04|159.6|23.3|136.3|14.61|
|2018-07-26|151.4|14.7|136.7|9.74|
|2018-11-08|152.6|14.0|138.6|9.15|
|2019-04-05|156.5|19.4|137.1|12.41|

While I was doing my serious training for BMDM 2019, I deliberately
let my weight creep up as long as my performance was increasing.  I
was assuming that some of my weight gain was muscle mass, but I wasn't
taking the time to go down to UNM and check.  It looks like I was
wrong, so I do not plan on letting my weight creep up for 2020.

One thing about my 2019-04-05 hydrostatic weighing is that I did it in
the morning after fasting the entire night and doing a 6.56 mile ruck
run, whereas 2018-11-08 was a Thursday afternoon weighing with only a
four hour fast.  I am going to go back to Thursday afternoon weighings
in the future and although I was planning on not going more than a
month before my next one, life got in the way.

So, comparing my 2019-04-05 stats to 2018-03-29, I'm pretty happy with
the progress I've made in a year. However, when comparing to
2018-11-08, I'm disappointed, although there's plenty of room for
improvement.

Oh, and Winning Coffee closed down, so we're no longer holding Cocoa
Conspiracy there on Thursday mornings, which means it's impossible for
me to *completely* replicate my sleeping and eating pattern leading up
to my 2018-11-08 hydrostatic weighing. That too has contributed to me
not getting a weighing done recently.

My April 5th run was using George's Goruck pack with the 30 pound
plate in it. When I weighed it, I got 32.5 pounds.  I normally train
with 40 pounds, but today I was more concerned with testing the pack
than training, per-se.  My lower back is *still* not completely
recovered from BMDM.

My May 8th run was with a Kelty Trekker that I bought back when I
couldn't find a Tioga to replace the first Tioga I had.  I used it
once and didn't like it. The dislike encouraged me to try searching
harder, which I did, and I found a Tioga.  However, since I have the
Believe in Heroes ruck 5k coming up, I figured I'd give my Trekker a
try again.  This time I took a couple barbells and a lifting plate,
wrapped them in a towel and used that.  Unfortunately everything
shifted to one side and one of the stays got significantly bent.  This
put a fair amount of strain on my back, but I was OK for Elevation
Insanity on Saturday (although the weather, construction and our slow
turnaround times led to us only doing 5 ascents, rather than 6).

Starting May 8th my "typical" week should have had me doing 15.5 miles
Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, with Mondays including interval
training and Wednesdays having been 40# pack runs.  Fridays 130bpm
"normal" runs, Tuesdays and Thursdays 8.9 mile 130bpm with a big event
on Saturday and bike riding on Sunday.

In reality, between the Trekker being ill-suited to pack training and
my various races, I only completed that schedule once, at least through
the week of Monday, June 10th.

I got a Goruck Rucker 20L, w/30# plate, waist-belt and sternum strap
on June 4th.  I took it out for a spin on June 5th, after adding a 5
pound plate and a bladder.  Overall, I'm very happy, but it's going to
take some getting used to and I'll probably have to futz around to get
everything attached / tensioned in the best way.  As it is, to use the
hip belt, the pack needs to ride fairly low, which is disappointing.
My shoulders took a bit of a beating on the June 5th test ride, even
with the waist belt and sternum strap.

On June 12th, I did another 15.6 mile with my Rucker 20L.  This time
I lowered the sternum strap one increment and also didn't attach my
water bladder to the top.  The pocket that holds the bladder is wide
enough that last time when I attached the clip to the top of my ruck,
the side-to-side motion was enough to slide the clip off, which caused
me to leak some water.  This time I had no leak, but it was hotter and
so even with 40 oz. of water in the bladder, I _still_ ran out.
I also adjusted the shoulder straps slightly, but I think I made them
just a little two short, so not as much weight was on my hips.  I'm
pretty sure my pack "ride" was much smoother this time, but my stats
don't show it due to the excessive heat (67.6F at the start, 80.2F at
the end).

June 15th was supposed to be a Crest Trail Hike (approx. 27 miles),
with a 50# ruck, and that's how it started.  However 48 oz. (4 cans)
of that was beer that I drank on the way.  Completely unrelated, our
hike got cut short when one of our participants got minorly struck by
lightning.  She's OK, although she rode an ambulance to the hospital
as a precaution and an X-ray revealed she received a small stress
fracture in one of her feet.

On June 16th I did a little running with Team RWB and then a little
dog walking with my wife.  In both cases I had my ruck at 44 pounds,
which was basically 40 pounds with 70 oz. of water that I never
touched.  I'm still futzing around with the pack to figure out the
best way to distribute weight.

On June 22nd, Jeff, Jan and I hiked and ran a _modified_ Sandia Crest
Trail ["double
crossing"](https://fastestknowntime.com/route/crest-trail-130-sandia-mtns-nm),
meaning we started at Tunnel Springs, went south to Canyon Estates and
then back to Tunnel Springs.  However, instead of sticking 100% to the
Crest Trail, we used Agua Sarca and CCC on the way down to cut off
some miles. Similarly, we used CCC and Ojo del Orno on the way back.
Agua Sarca, CCC and Ojo del Orno are mentioned on the Sandia Mountain
Hiking Guide [web page](http://www.sandiahiking.com/trailguide.html).

Our modified double crossing would have only been 42 miles, but I led
Jan off trail accidentally and we did a bit of extra bushwhacking.  We
deliberately ran slowly or hiked so I'd have a little oomph in my legs
to "race" the Cherry Garcia 5k the next day.

June 26th was short as part of a rest week to try to get my morning
resting HR to 41 or below.  I had been doing some big weeks and it was
time for a small break.  However, June 26th was the 1.00 mile day for
the Team RWB [1776
challenge](https://www.teamrwb.org/national-events/1776-challenge/),
so I figured I may as well run with my ruck (it being a Wednesday).
Similarly, I figured if I was going to have my ruck, I should do at
least one AA lap and ... since I was _only_ going to do one, I may as
well run at at least race pace.

June 30th was with Team RWB.  Initially I ran with the fastest
runners, but I switched around whom I ran with.  My bpm for my average
pace is a bit high, but it was hot (80F at the end) and I ran my first
few miles fast enough to get my HR higher than if I had run the same
pace throughout: 8:45, 9:15, 9:22, 11:09, 11:21, 11:03.  I ran my last
few miles with Cathy Powers of [Running Fir
Wreaths](https://www.cathypowers.com/running-fir-wreaths2.html).
