# Bataan Memorial Death March training

Cliff Matthews's training plan for the 2019 [Bataan
Memorial Death March](http://bataanmarch.com) (civilian heavy),
similar to what I did for [2017](2017.md) and [2018](2018.md).

## What is the BMDM?

The Bataan Memorial Death March is a tribute to the men and women who
defended the Philippines at the onset of World War II.  They suffered
greatly and many perished either during the defense, after they were
surrendered and forced to march on quarter rations, at the inhumane
prison camps, the hell-ships that carried them to Japan or in the
forced labor thereafter.

Some of those men and women, now in their nineties, are still alive.  In
1989, members of the Army ROTC Department at New Mexico State University
started an annual march to honor these veterans.  The march has grown
considerably since then and although it was initially open only to
military members, it has been opened up to civilians.  These days
participation is about half and half.

## Why do I do it?

I attended my first BMDM in 2010.  I knew that in principle it was a
good cause, but it wasn't until I heard the vets tell their histories
that I was hooked.

Although that first march took me seven and a half hours and beat the
hell out of me, I decided to return each year as long as the original
vets were still coming out.  I also decided to volunteer for search
and rescue (SAR) since I realized I met the physical requirements and
knew that SAR was a tiny way I could say thanks with more than a word
and a handshake.

In addition to honoring veterans, training for BMDM keeps me fit for
SAR missions.

## How do I train?

I was totally unprepared my first year.  I did only four practice
hikes, each with a 35 pound pack, each with an increasing distance.
The terrain was sandy (because I had read about the sand pits) and I
wore hiking boots.  That was not a heavy enough pack to train with;
that wasn't enough training days, and the surface was too soft.  So,
when I attended my first BMDM, my feet hurt quite a bit by mile six.
I could barely walk the last several miles.

In the last few years I started training in November, but in 2017 I
started doing weekly pack runs in late August.  In my non-training
months I've tried to do _something_ with my pack at least once a month
between BMDM and when I start training.  Often that is a search and
rescue mission or two, but&mdash;assuming I'm healthy&mdash;I'll go
out and do a big hike with a fifty pound pack on a month with no
significant missions.

During training, starting in November, I run with my pack on
Wednesdays and on Saturdays.  My Wednesday runs are done as quickly as
I can and start from and end at my house.  Typically I increase the
distance by a half mile each week.  My Saturday runs alternate between
a level run at race pace and a run five miles up and five miles down
the local mountain.  My level run distance typically increases by
three miles.  My mountain run stays the same distance, but I try to do
it faster each time.

In addition to my pack runs, I also run without my pack the remaining
days of the week except Sunday, when I ride my bike.

## Is this training plan safe?

No.  If you run with a pack, you risk injury.  I have worked up to
this training plan over several years.  The overall plan of doing two
pack runs a week with running and cycling in between is probably
doable for anyone who has already run a marathon or two, although the
times, distances and weight should probably be lessened.

## Base building

In previous years, my BMDM training has begun in mid November.  I was
not happy with my performance @ BMDM in March of 2017, so that year I
started doing Wednesday pack runs in late August.  I also stopped
tapering and taking recovery days after my August through November
races.

I did fine without the taper or recovery days for all of my races
until the Tucson marathon.  I caught a pretty bad cold (or maybe it
was the flu) a week after Tucson that I _may_ have avoided had I
either spent a little time recovering or not done as much celebratory
drinking.  On the other hand, my son had caught the same bug before I
did and my wife caught it shortly after.  Friends and relatives caught
it around the same time, so maybe I'd have fallen sick regardless.

## Weight loss

On March 29th I went down to UNM and was hydrostatically weighed.  My
body fat percentage was 21.95%.  That was a wake-up call, so I decided
to experiment with losing weight and trying to not lose power.  I was
a little nervous that doing so would interfere with my ability to finish
Cruel Jewel 100, but it was just the opposite.  I finished CJ100 much
quicker than I expected, in part&mdash;I believe&mdash;due to my weight loss.

My goal is to get my body fat percentage down to 7.3%.  Based on my
first hydrostatic weighing, that would have been approximately 156
pounds, except I had a second hydrostatic weighing on June 4th.  I
weighed 159.6, which was a 25.9 pound loss, but 8.5 of that was lean
muscle mass.

After that weighing, I raised the number of calories and the amount of
protein I was taking during some of my more lengthy runs.  The change
was successful.  I had my third weighing on July 26th and I lost 8.6
pounds of fat and gained .4 pounds of muscle:

|Test Date|Body Weight|Fat Weight|Fat Free Weight|Body Fat %|
|---------|-----------|----------|---------------|----------|
|2018-03-29|185.5|40.7|144.8|21.95|
|2018-06-04|159.6|23.3|136.3|14.61|
|2018-07-26|151.4|14.7|136.7|9.74|

Once I get to 7.3% (147.5 pounds), I'll ramp up my carbohydrate intake
and increase the intensity of some of my training days.  I'll
concentrate on building my BMDM base.

Initially, I've was doing some ultra-specific training so I could pace
my brother-in-law at Leadville (he finished in 27:20) and then "run"
the Tahoe 200 three weeks later.  Now that I've finished T200, I'll
concentrate more on building my BMDM base, although I have a bunch of
ultras in the upcoming weekends.

## Non-pack Days

During the week I do slow runs from my house out to Albuquerque Academy,
some distance around Albuquerque Academy and back to my house.  On Sundays
I ride my bike along the Bosque Bike trail.  How far I ride is dependent
on weather, mood, how much time I want to be out and to a lesser extent
how beat up I am from my Saturday activity. I usually ride my bike between 35 and 50
miles the day after a La Luz pack run and 35 miles the day after a Bosque
Bike Path pack run.

On Mondays I run from my house to Albuquerque Academy, run two laps
around AA and back. However there are eight places during that run where
I run as fast as I can for a set amount of time.  In mid November that
amount of time is seventy five seconds.  I may increase it if I seem
to plateau.  However, if I do increase it and my Wednesday pace suffers,
I'll back off.

In theory, I try to keep my heart-rate at about 130bpm for my slow
runs and bike ride, but if it's chilly or I'm rushed or otherwise
feeling frisky I may run, or bike, a bit faster.

This is what I did up until BMDM 2018

|Day|Activity|Amount|
|---|--------|------|
|Sunday|Bike Ride|35 - 70 miles|
|Monday|Interval Training|8.9 miles|
|Tuesday|Slow Run|3 miles|
|Thursday|Slow Run|5.6 miles|
|Friday|Slow Run| 3 miles|

Starting in April 2018, I upped my schedule to:

|Day|Activity|Amount|
|---|--------|------|
|Sunday|Bike Ride|35 - 70 miles|
|Monday|Interval Training|13.1 miles|
|Tuesday|Slow Run|8.9 miles|
|Thursday|Slow Run|8.9 miles|
|Friday|Slow Run|13.1 miles|

I don't yet have a feel for what I'm *really* going to do come
November.  My guess is that I'll back off some of the mileage in order
to concentrate more heavily on my pack runs.  In the meantime, I'm
really enjoying the increased mileage, and I think that significantly
helped me finish the Tahoe 200.


## Pack (and exception) days

In the following table, `speed` means as quickly as I can to minimize
the total time I spend. This year it should be about a 9:30
minute/mile pace when running with my pack.  My speed during my
non-pack races (e.g., Sandia Snowshoe Race and the Mt. Taylor Winter
Quadrathlon) varies greatly.

`Race` is my race goal of 10:18 minute/mile.

`Mountain` means I'm running
up and down a mountain and trying to minimize my time.  I run the same
mountain course every other weekend.  As my fitness increases, so does
my pace.  My record, in February 2016, was a 14:15 minute/mile pace.  I
hope to better that this year, but it'll be tough.

`Comfort` means I'll
keep my HR between below 150bpm during the training or event.
I'm out there to have fun.

`Pace` meant whatever it took to be the best pacer possible for my
brother-in-law as he finished his first Leadville 100.  Turns out
the little bugger was plagued with GI trouble that slowed him down
for much of the return from Winfield, then&mdash;after that
subsided&mdash;he wanted to run the final
seven or eight miles. Fun!

When I run from my house, I typically run over to Albuquerque Academy,
then run around it some distance before coming back.  As such, I
typically have to wait at a stoplight a couple of times or more and
it's hillier than the Bosque Bike path, which has neither stops nor
hills.


## My plan

In addition to the runs in the following table, I may do others.  My
[Marathon
Maniacs](http://www.marathonmaniacsdb.com/Maniacs/MyRaces?ManiacId=4395)
and
[UltraSignup](http://ultrasignup.com/results_participant.aspx?fname=Clifford&lname=Matthews)
pages should list anything major.

### Wednesday pack runs

I sprained my ankle six days after BMDM, so I didn't do another pack
run until Thursday, April 26th, when I chose to run 8.9 miles at about
a 130bpm heart rate with a 31.5# pack as part of a plan to slowly get
back into running on Wednesdays with a 40# pack.

I'm going to go ahead and log all my pack runs as I do them.  In general,
I'm base building until the beginning of November.

On May 30th, my plan was to run 13.1 miles with a 40 pound pack while
keeping my heart rate at 130bpm, but with the proviso that if I wasn't
done two and a half hours in, I could "stop".  Sure enough, I was a
quarter mile from home when 2:30 rolled around, so I walked to my home
and only got 12.26 miles in.  I consumed 40 oz. of water with 600
calories of Tailwind, but I didn't have extra caffeine, nor did I wear
my ice hat or have breakfast.  I also didn't have any water in my pack,
so when I was out of water from my handhelds, I was out.

On June 6th, I had the same plan (13.1 miles, 40#, 130bpm) and I got
12.52 miles in by 2:30.  My pack was slightly light, because I had put
it together the day before (or maybe even two days before) and some of
the weight was water in a 100 oz. bladder that leaked a little.  I
also used 20 oz. of the water so that instead of consuming 2 handhelds
with 300 calories each, I consumed 3.  That gave me more oomph at the
end, although it also meant that I was running with 20 oz. less in my
pack at the end.

One other thing I did differently this week was I drank a pint of
water with 3 tablespoons of chia seeds (180 calories) mixed in (ten
minutes before I drank it) shortly after I got up.  I think that the
added 180 calories before my workout and the added 300 calories during
my workout helped keep my pace up at the end.

The way I've done non-taper Wednesdays since has been more or less
what I did on June 6th.  I now easily finish 13.1 miles in less than
2:30.  I haven't been using my ice hat, because I'm letting my body
get used to the heat, since that's one of the things that hits me hard
@ BMDM.

*HRM was giving erratic readings, many of them high, computed average HR was 131, but the graph is implausible and there were many times when I was running with what felt like less than 130bpm effort and the HRM was showing well over 130bpm for a while, then it would drop back down all w/o me changing effort.  This is a known failure mode when the battery runs low.  I'm going to change it.

**After changing the battery two weeks ago, I got better readings, until August 8th.  I suspected the battery was going dead and the battery tester confirmed that. So, I replaced the battery and did a small pack run the following day and was able to run much faster with a lower HR.  Part of that was due to it being before the sun was over the mountains, it being a shorter distance, it being cooler and me having had pizza and beer the night prior (topping up my glycogen), but the difference was still sufficiently dramatic that I'm confident that my August 8th HR readings really were off.

### Planned (includes non-ruck endurance events)

In this table, all pack runs starting on November 17th are likely to
change.  I put them on the calendar before I lost a lot of weight and
started doing Wednesday 13.1 mile pack runs.  It's likely that by mid
November I'll be doing three pack runs a week.  As such, this year's
training will probably be a big departure from what I've been doing in
previous years, although I will probably continue to switch between La Luz
and Bosque Bike Path runs on Saturdays.

The biggest thing I have to do is stay healthy and uninjured.  If I do that,
the rest will take care of itself.
