# 2022 Bataan Memorial Death March training log

I do this every year.  There's more info in [the top-level README.md](README.md).  Whee!

## Cocodona 250

Although I have not yet signed up for it, I'm mentally committed to running
the Cocodona 250 on May 2nd. Additionally, I won't be running the official
Bataan Memorial Death March this year. As such, I'm altering my training
slightly. Whenever there's a potential trade-off between BMDM performance
and Cocodona performance, I'm opting for the latter.

An example of this is participating in the Academy of Pain run on
January 15th. In a normal training year I would not do a twelve hour
non-pack run in the middle of January. However, doing it _this year_
makes sense.

*Covid: My wife tested positive for covid and I've had most of her
symptoms, but much milder (and _her_ symptoms are around what someone
with a bad cold or a light flu would have).  So, I haven't been doing
my normal exercises this week (in part due to a minor foot and a minor
knee injury) and will stay away from people for a while.  My decision
to not do my December 11th mountain pack run was due to the very
slight possibility that I would fall and hurt myself and require
assistance on a very cold day. IOW, I was feeling sufficiently well to
run it, but chose not to due to an over abundance of caution.

I was planning on doing my pack interval training on Monday, December
13th, but some minor family stuff that was covid related (but not
actual illness on my part) got in the way, which is probably just as
well since it gave my back, foot and knee a little more time to heal.

**On December 25th, my initial plan was to go and do my pack run early,
but I wasn't feeling 100% and started working in the morning.  It then
got late enough that if I had gone out to run I'd miss my immediate
family members' celebration, so I decided to do the pack run the
following day, but I wound up drinking from about 1pm to about 8pm
Christmas day and decided not to do the mountain run on Sunday when I
was going to be doing intervals with my pack the following day.

Then, the following day I _still_ wasn't feeling 100%, but I did get
ready to do my pack intervals until I realized the lowest curved tube
that connects my two external frame uprights was broken.  This is a
new place for my Tioga to break.  I've had one or more uprights break
on two different occasions and both times resulted in debilitating
pain for me, so I chose not to do about three hours, even though the
break didn't appear to have the same structural ramifications.

***On January 15th, I (foolishly, in retrospect) chose to celebrate 50
miles by drinking a 16 oz. 12.9% ABV Barrel-Aged Narwhal while walking
my fifteenth lap. That felt so good and there was so much time left
that I then walked another lap drinking a 16 oz. 7.5% Malpais Stout. I
felt great when I finished, but got pretty sick on Sunday and the
body-ache (and attendant loss of sleep) and junk in my lungs persisted
for over a week. Live and learn.
