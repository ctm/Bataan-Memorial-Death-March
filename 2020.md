It's too early to set up my training schedule for 2020, but I am going to
log my body fat percentages and ruck runs

|Test Date|Body Weight|Fat Weight|Fat Free Weight|Body Fat %|
|---------|-----------|----------|---------------|----------|
|2018-03-29|185.5|40.7|144.8|21.95|
|2018-06-04|159.6|23.3|136.3|14.61|
|2018-07-26|151.4|14.7|136.7|9.74|
|2018-11-08|152.6|14.0|138.6|9.15|
|2019-04-05|156.5|19.4|137.1|12.41|

While I was doing my serious training for BMDM 2019, I deliberately
let my weight creep up as long as my performance was increasing.  I
was assuming that some of my weight gain was muscle mass, but I wasn't
taking the time to go down to UNM and check.  It looks like I was
wrong, so I do not plan on letting my weight creep up for 2020.

One thing about my 2019-04-05 hydrostatic weighing is that I did it in
the morning after fasting the entire night and doing a 6.56 mile ruck
run, whereas 2018-11-08 was a Thursday afternoon weighing with only a
four hour fast.  I am going to go back to Thursday afternoon weighings
in the future and am not going to go more than a month before my next
one.

So, comparing my 2019-04-05 stats to 2018-03-29, I'm pretty happy with
the progress I've made in a year. However, when comparing to
2018-11-08, I'm disappointed, although there's plenty of room for
improvement.


|Date|Miles|Pace|Pounds|Where|Notes|
|----|-----|----|------|-----|-----|
|Apr 5|6.56|comfort|32.5|from house|1:14:09, 130bpm, 11:18 min/mi, Goruck test|

My April 5th run was using George's Goruck pack with the 30 pound
plate in it. When I weighed it, I got 32.5 pounds.  I normally train
with 40 pounds, but today I was more concerned with testing the pack
than training, per-se.  My lower back is *still* not completely
recovered from BMDM.
