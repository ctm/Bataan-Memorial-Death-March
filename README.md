# Bataan Memorial Death March and Tough Ruck training

My (Cliff Matthews) training plan for the 2020 [Bataan Memorial Death
March](http://bataanmarch.com) (civilian heavy), similar to what I did
for [2017](2017.md), [2018](2018.md) and [2019](2019.md).  In addition
to BMDM 2020, I've registered for the [Tough
Ruck](http://www.toughruck.org/).

## What is the BMDM?

The Bataan Memorial Death March is a tribute to the men and women who
defended the Philippines at the onset of World War II.  They suffered
greatly and many perished either during the defense, after they were
surrendered and were forced to march (having subsisted on quarter
rations prior to the start of the march), at the inhumane prison
camps, the hell-ships that carried them to Japan or in the forced
labor thereafter.

Some of those men and women, now in their nineties (or more!), are
still alive.  In 1989, members of the Army ROTC Department at New
Mexico State University started an annual march to honor these
veterans.  The march has grown considerably since then and although it
was initially open only to military members, they began allowing
civilians early on.  These days, participation is about half and half.
For the record, I am a civilian, although my father was in the Air
Force and there's a good chance at least one of my daughters will
serve.

## Why do I do it?

I attended my first BMDM in 2010.  I knew that in principle it was a
good cause, but it wasn't until I heard the vets tell their histories
that I was hooked.

Although that first march took me seven and a half hours and beat the
heck out of me, I decided to return each year as long as the original
vets were still coming out.  I also decided to volunteer for search
and rescue (SAR) since I realized I met the physical requirements and
knew that SAR was a tiny way I could say thanks with more than a word
and a handshake.

In addition to honoring veterans, training for BMDM keeps me fit for
SAR missions.

## How do I train?

I was totally unprepared my first year.  I did only four practice
hikes, each with a 35 pound pack, each with an increasing distance.
My hikes were in sandy terrain, because I had read about the sand
pits, and I wore hiking boots.  That was not a heavy enough pack to
train with; that wasn't enough training days, and the surface was too
soft.  So, when I attended my first BMDM, my feet hurt quite a bit by
mile six.  I could barely walk the last several miles.

Somewhere around 2014, I started training in November. Then, in 2017,
I started doing weekly pack runs in late August.  From 2014 until
2018, in my non-training months I tried to do _something_ with my pack
at least once a month in my "off season" (i.e., between BMDM and
whenever I started my weekly pack runs). Often that was a search and
rescue mission or two, but when my SAR team had no missions for a
month I did something like a big hike with a fifty pound pack.

Since 2014, I've been ramping up my training starting in November.
Until 2018, I'd run with my pack on Wednesdays and on Saturdays.
Starting in 2018 I did that but also ran with my pack on Mondays. My
Wednesday runs were done as quickly as I could and started from and
ended at my house.  Typically I increased the distance by a half mile
each week.  My Saturday runs alternated between a level run at race
pace and a run five miles up and five miles down La Luz Trail (i.e.,
the local mountain).  My level run distance typically increased by
three miles.  My mountain run stayed the same distance, but in theory
I tried to do it faster each time.  In reality, we had so much snow in
the 2018-2019 training season that I was more concerned with avoiding
injury than I was in improving my time.  My Monday run was 13.1 miles,
but incorporated 12 75 second all-out intervals in the middle.

In addition to my pack runs, I also ran without my pack the remaining
days of the week except Sunday, when in theory I rode my bike.  In
reality, I only rode my bike seven times (not counting The Quad)
between November 1st 2018 and March 23rd, mostly due to weather.

During the 2919 BMDM, my pack broke and I wound up with considerable
hip pain in the final miles of the event.  I tried switching to a new
pack in June, but that did not go well and I wound up injured to some
extent for much of the summer and early autumn of 2019 and I eventually
completely stopped doing pack runs until November 6th.

## Is this training plan safe?

No.  If you run with a pack, you risk injury.  I have worked up to
this training plan over several years.  A plan of doing _two_ pack
runs a week with running and cycling in between is probably doable for
anyone who has already run a marathon or two, although the times,
distances and weight should probably be lessened.  Three pack runs a
week is probably a bad idea for almost everyone.  In fact, I think
three pack runs a week for me in my 2018-2019 training cycle was
slightly excessive.  For one thing, the abrasions on my back never
completely healed, but additionally my resting heart rate crept up
slowly.  Due to this, for 2019-2020, I'm going to start out doing more
than two, but less than three pack runs a week by alternating between
three pack run and two pack run weeks.

## Base building

In previous years, my BMDM training has begun in mid November.  I was
not happy with my performance @ BMDM in March of 2017, so that year I
started doing Wednesday pack runs in late August.  I also stopped
tapering and taking recovery days after my August through November
races.

Due to my 2018 injuries, I'm slowly ramping up my pack training, as
is reflected in my plan below.  I am in better fitness than I was at
the beginning of my 2017-2018 season but much less fit than I was at
the beginning of my 2018-2019 training.  It will be hard to get back
to where I was.

## Non-pack Days

During the week I do slow runs from my house out to Albuquerque
Academy, some distance around Albuquerque Academy and back to my
house.  On Sundays I ride my bike.  How far I ride is dependent on
weather, mood, how much time I want to be out and to a lesser extent
how beat up I am from my Saturday activity. I usually ride my bike
between an hour to an hour and a half the day after a La Luz pack run
and an hour the day after a Bosque Bike Path pack run.

In previous years all my bike riding has been on the Bosque Bike Path.
At the start of this years training season, I'm without a vehicle with
a bike rack, so I'm going to experiment with riding my bike up to the
La Luz Trailhead.  That may help me with the quad, but it may also be
too taxing for a rest day.  I won't know until I try it.

On Mondays I run from my house to Albuquerque Academy, run three laps
around AA, back to my house and then do another .9 miles to bring the
total up to 13.1 miles. However, during that half marathon, I do
twelve all-outs of seventy-five seconds with only thirty seconds of
rest in between.  I alternate between doing my Monday run with a 40
pound pack and without a pack.  During my 2018-2019 training season I
was doing my Monday runs with a pack every week and I think that was
too much, so I'm experimenting with every other Monday being with the
pack.

In theory, I try to keep my heart-rate at about 130bpm for my slow
runs and bike ride, but if it's chilly or I'm rushed or otherwise
feeling frisky I may run, or bike, a bit faster.

So, for the 2019-2020 training season, here are my non-pack days:

|Day|Activity|Amount|
|---|--------|------|
|Sunday|Bike Ride|hour to hour and a half|
|every other Monday|Interval Training|13.1 miles|
|Tuesday|Slow Run|8.9 miles|
|Thursday|Slow Run|8.9 miles|
|Friday|Slow Run|13.1 miles|

Last year I took many Fridays off so I could run harder on Saturday.
I'm not convinced that was the right thing to do.  I already take my
resting heart-rate early in the morning.  My plan is to cut back some
of my rest days (including possibly taking a Friday off) if it creeps
up.  I'll also be monitoring my performance on my pack days and may
reduce the activity on my rest days if I am not happy with my
performance.  This is going to be a tricky balancing act, since I'm
starting the training season with less fitness than last year (but
more fitness than any other year).

## Pack (and exception) days

In the following table, `speed` means as quickly as I can to minimize
the total time I spend. This year it should be about a 9:30
minute/mile pace when running with my pack.  My speed during my
non-pack races (e.g., Sandia Snowshoe Race and the Mt. Taylor Winter
Quadrathlon) varies greatly.

`Race` is my race goal of 10:18 minute/mile.

`Mountain`: I'm running up and down a mountain and trying to minimize
my time.  I run the same mountain course every other weekend.  As my
fitness increases, so does my pace.  My record, in February 2016, was
a 14:15 minute/mile pace.  I should be able to better this year.

`Comfort`: I'll keep my HR between below 150bpm during the training or
event.  I'm out there to have fun.

`Interval`: Interval training with my forty pound pack, wrapped with
enough low heart rate running on either end to be a total of 13.1
miles with an average heart rate of 130bpm.  The intervals themselves
are 12 all-outs of 75 seconds each, with 30 seconds of light running
as rest in between.

When I run from my house, I typically run over to Albuquerque Academy,
then run around it some distance before coming back.  As such, I
typically have to wait at a stoplight a couple of times or more and
it's hillier than the Bosque Bike path, which has neither stops nor
hills.

### Packs

I'm currently training with my Osprey search-and-rescue pack.  I have not
yet sent my Goruck 20L back for repair, but I will do that soon.  It may
take some time to get a replacement, but I need to get fit again before
I try again to transition to my Goruck 20L.  This time I'll try without
the hip belt which I think was counter-productive.


### Tough Ruck Campaign

[My Tough Ruck
Campaign](https://charity.gofundme.com/o/en/campaign-manager/edit/cliffmatthews/gratitude-higher-than-my-expectations/campaign)
is named "Gratitude higher than my expectations" which is a phrase
that comes from Ray Wylie Hubbard's ["Mother
Blue's"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIQVG0Bcu6w).  I have no
association with RWH, other than as an anonymous fan, but I am very
grateful and honored.
