It's too early to set up my training schedule for 2020, but I am going to
log my body fat percentages and ruck runs

|Test Date|Body Weight|Fat Weight|Fat Free Weight|Body Fat %|
|---------|-----------|----------|---------------|----------|
|2018-03-29|185.5|40.7|144.8|21.95|
|2018-06-04|159.6|23.3|136.3|14.61|
|2018-07-26|151.4|14.7|136.7|9.74|
|2018-11-08|152.6|14.0|138.6|9.15|
|2019-04-05|156.5|19.4|137.1|12.41|

While I was doing my serious training for BMDM 2019, I deliberately
let my weight creep up as long as my performance was increasing.  I
was assuming that some of my weight gain was muscle mass, but I wasn't
taking the time to go down to UNM and check.  It looks like I was
wrong, so I do not plan on letting my weight creep up for 2020.

One thing about my 2019-04-05 hydrostatic weighing is that I did it in
the morning after fasting the entire night and doing a 6.56 mile ruck
run, whereas 2018-11-08 was a Thursday afternoon weighing with only a
four hour fast.  I am going to go back to Thursday afternoon weighings
in the future and am not going to go more than a month before my next
one.

So, comparing my 2019-04-05 stats to 2018-03-29, I'm pretty happy with
the progress I've made in a year. However, when comparing to
2018-11-08, I'm disappointed, although there's plenty of room for
improvement.

My April 5th run was using George's Goruck pack with the 30 pound
plate in it. When I weighed it, I got 32.5 pounds.  I normally train
with 40 pounds, but today I was more concerned with testing the pack
than training, per-se.  My lower back is *still* not completely
recovered from BMDM.

My May 8th run was with a Kelty Trekker that I bought back when I
couldn't find a Tioga to replace the first Tioga I had.  I used it
once and didn't like it, tried hard and found a Tioga.  However, since
I have the Believe in Heroes ruck 5k coming up, I figured I'd give it
a try again.  This time I took a couple barbells and a lifting plate,
wrapped them in a towel and used that.  Unfortunately everything
shifted to one side and one of the stays got significantly bent.  This
put a fair amount of strain on my back, but I think I'll be OK for
Elevation Insanity on Saturday.

Between now (May 8th) and when I taper for Hardrock, most of my weeks
have me doing 15.5 miles Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, with Mondays
including interval training.  Starting today, Wednesdays will be 40#
pack runs.  Fridays will just be 130bpm "normal" runs.  Tuesdays and
Thursdays will be 8.9 mile 130bpm and typically I'll have a big event
on Saturday and ride my bike on Sunday.

Oh, and Winning Coffee closed down, so we're no longer holding Cocoa
Conspiracy there on Thursday mornings, which means it's impossible for
me to *completely* replicate my sleeping and eating pattern leading up
to my 2018-11-08 hydrostatic weighing. Oh well, I'll probably still
get one done on a Thursday afternoon before too long.
