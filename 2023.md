# 2023 Bataan Memorial Death March Training Log

I mostly do this every year.  There's more info in [the top-level
README.md](README.md).  My goal for 2023 is to compete in various ruck
events and try to take first overall in each, even though I'll be
sixty years old. [My tentative
schedule](https://ctm.github.io/docs/yld/running/upcoming.html)
includes many events.  I'll be racing the ruck ones, but mostly just
having fun in the others.

### Warm-up

A month and a half before I will turn 60, [I
ran](https://www.webscorer.com/racedetails?raceid=293591&did=350019&cid=1738637&gender=M)
the [Feral Hog
50k](http://www.feraladventures.com/challenges/feral-hog-50k/) in the
ruck division as a test. It was the first time I've competitively
rucked at a distance longer than a marathon.  It also has a bunch of
elevation change. On the other hand, it was relatively cool and rainy
and my ruck only weighed about twenty four pounds, so I didn't beat
myself up much. Additionally, it was at the end of the [Albuquerque
International Balloon Fiesta](https://balloonfiesta.com/) and I
definitely lost fitness that week (/me makes the lifting-a-pint-glass
motion).

## Cocodona 250 Takes a Backseat in 2023

Last year, with the Bataan Memorial Death March not being held in
person, I half-assedly trained. At the culmination of my training, I
did a substitute run.  Since I knew that I was training for a
substitute, I deliberately modified my training to prioritize
adaptations to allow me to finish the Cocodona 250, an early May race.

I did indeed finish the Cocodona 250 in 2022, but it was an easier
course than normal (due to a last minute reroute to avoid a foret
fire). As such, I plan on doing the Cocodona 250 again in 2023, but I
am going to prioritize my rucking over my C250 training and just
assume I'll have sufficient fitness to finish C250 w/o trouble.

### Future

I plan to do the trainings in this table, but I'm a husband, the
father of three children, and the founder of [a
company](https://craftpoker.com).  My family and company come first,
_however_ I believe I serve both of them best by living up to my
commitments and training hard for BMDM and Tough Ruck is a commitment
I take very seriously.

### Past

Between my 2022 substitute BMDM event and the 2022 Feral Hog 50k, I
did a bunch of maintenance ruck trainings.  I log all my events to
[Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/58696205), but I didn't
create line entries for them.

In theory, my _serious_ training for BMDM was to have started on
November 14th, but I worked instead, in part because I wasn't fully
recovered from my "fun" around block.
