# 2026 Bataan Memorial Death March Training Log

I do this every year.  There's more info in [the top-level
README.md](README.md) (although some of it may be outdated, due to me
having less time than normal).  My goal for 2026 is to be competitive
at the [Bataan Memorial Death March](https://bataanmarch.com/) and to
continue inspiring others.

### "More Later"

On September 6th, 2025, the [BMDM Facebook
page](https://www.facebook.com/BataanMemorialDeathMarch/) posted that
registration opens October 1st. Presumably by then they'll update their
web page and describe the course.  If they have restored Mineral Hill,
I'll sign up.  If not, I'll probably wait a bit before signing up.

Sometime after I learn more about the 2026 event, I'll update this
page.  In the meantime, I've put a tentative training plan in place.
It's just the 2025 plan with dates shifted so that day-of-week specific
trainings are on the correct day of the week, while holiday-specific
trainings are attached to their appropriate holidays.

### Survivors

On July 15th, 2025, Valdemar DeHerrera died.  He was 105.  On August
15th, James Bollich turned 104. As far as I know, James is still
alive.  With Valdemar's death, James probably became the last living
survivor of the Bataan Death March. Valdemar was present at
BMDM 2023. James was one of two speakers at BMDM 2019 (the last in
person BMDM before the three year covid hiatus).
