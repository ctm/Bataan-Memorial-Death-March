# Bataan Memorial Death March training

Cliff Matthews's training plan for the 2018 [Bataan
Memorial Death March](http://bataanmarch.com) (civilian heavy).  This
is very similar to [what I did for 2017](2017.md).

## What is the BMDM?

The Bataan Memorial Death March is a tribute to the men and women who
defended the Philippines at the onset of World War II.  They suffered
greatly and many perished either during the defense, after they were
surrendered and forced to march on quarter rations, at the inhumane
prison camps, the hell-ships that carried them to Japan or in the
forced labor thereafter.

Some of those men and women, now in their nineties, are still alive.  In
1989, members of the Army ROTC Department at New Mexico State University
started an annual march to honor these veterans.  The march has grown
considerably since then and although it was initially open only to
military members, it has been opened up to civilians.  These days
participation is about half and half.

## Why do I do it?

I attended my first BMDM in 2010.  I knew that in principle it was a
good cause, but it wasn't until I heard the vets tell their histories
that I was hooked.

Although that first march took me seven and a half hours and beat the
hell out of me, I decided to return each year as long as the original
vets were still coming out.  I also decided to volunteer for search
and rescue since I realized I met the physical requirements and knew
that SAR was a tiny way I could say thanks with more than a word and
a handshake.

In addition to honoring veterans, training for BMDM keeps me fit for
SAR missions.

## How do I train?

I was totally unprepared my first year.  I did only four practice
hikes, each with a 35 pound pack, each with an increasing distance.
The terrain was sandy (because I had read about the sand pits) and I
wore hiking boots.  That was not a heavy enough pack to train with;
that wasn't enough training days, and the surface was too soft.  So,
when I attended my first BMDM, my feet hurt quite a bit by mile six.
I could barely walk the last several miles.

For the last few years I've begun training in November, although I try
to do _something_ with my pack at least once a month between BMDM and
when I start training.  Often that is a search and rescue mission or
two, but&mdash;assuming I'm healthy&mdash;I'll go out and do a big
hike with a fifty pound pack on a month with no significant missions.

During training, I run with my pack on Wednesdays and on Saturdays.
My Wednesday runs are done as quickly as I can and start from and end
at my house.  Typically I increase the distance by a half mile each
week.  My Saturday runs alternate between a level run at race pace and
a run five miles up and five miles down the local mountain.  My level
run distance typically increases by three miles.  My mountain run
stays the same distance, but I try to do it faster each time.

In addition to my pack runs, I also run without my pack the remaining
days of the week except Sunday, when I ride my bike.

## Is this training plan safe?

No.  If you run with a pack, you are at risk of injuring yourself.  I
have worked up to this training plan over several years.  The overall
plan of doing two pack runs a week with running and cycling in between
is probably doable for anyone who has already run a marathon or two,
although the times, distances and weight should probably be lessened.

## Base building

In previous years, my BMDM training has begun in mid November.  I was not
happy with my performance in 2017, so this year I started doing Wednesday
pack runs in late August.  I also stopped tapering and taking recovery days
after my August through November races.

I did fine without the taper or recovery days for all of my races
until the Tucson marathon.  I caught a pretty bad cold (or maybe it
was the flu) a week after Tucson that I _may_ have avoided had I
either spent a little time recovering or not done as much celebratory
drinking.  On the other hand, my son had caught the same bug before I
did and my wife caught it shortly after.  Friends and relatives caught
it around the same time, so maybe I'd have fallen sick regardless.

## Non-pack Days

During the week I do slow runs from my house out to Albuquerque Academy,
some distance around Albuquerque Academy and back to my house.  On Sundays
I ride my bike along the Bosque Bike trail.  How far I ride is dependent
on weather, mood, how much time I want to be out and to a lesser extent
how beat up I am from my Saturday activity. I usually ride my bike between 35 and 50
miles the day after a La Luz pack run and 35 miles the day after a Bosque
Bike Path pack run.

On Mondays I run from my house to Albuquerque Academy, run two laps
around AA and back. However there are eight places during that run where
I run as fast as I can for a set amount of time.  In mid November that
amount of time is seventy five seconds.  I may increase it if I seem
to plateau.  However, if I do increase it and my Wednesday pace suffers,
I'll back off.

In theory, I try to keep my heart-rate at about 130bpm for my slow
runs and bike ride, but if it's chilly or I'm rushed or otherwise
feeling frisky I may run, or bike, a bit faster.

|Day|Activity|Amount|
|---|--------|------|
|Sunday|Bike Ride|35 - 70 miles|
|Monday|Interval Training|8.9 miles|
|Tuesday|Slow Run|3 miles|
|Thursday|Slow Run|5.6 miles|
|Friday|Slow Run| 3 miles|

## Pack (and exception) days

In the following table, `speed` means as quickly as I can to minimize
the total time I spend. This year it should be about a 9:30
minute/mile pace when running with my pack.  My speed during my
non-pack races (e.g., Sandia Snowshoe Race and the Mt. Taylor Winter
Quadrathlon) varies greatly!

`Race` is my race goal of 10:18 minute/mile.

`Mountain` means I'm running
up and down a mountain and trying to minimize my time.  I run the same
mountain course every other weekend.  As my fitness increases, so does
my pace.  My record, in February 2016, was a 14:15 minute/mile pace.  I
hope to better that this year, but it'll be tough.

`Comfort` means I'll
keep my HR between 140bpm and 150bpm during the Foothills Fat Ass 50k.
I'm out there to have fun and to take a break from training.


## My plan

In addition to the runs in the following table, I may do others.  My

and
[UltraSignup](http://ultrasignup.com/results_participant.aspx?fname=Clifford&lname=Matthews)

&dagger;On December 13th, I only ran 0.49 miles, because my pack
started poking me in the back one quarter mile in.  This was a new
pack that I bought to replace my previous one which had torn due to
the stress I've put on it over the last couple of years.

Although the new pack required minimal assembly, I still managed to do
it wrong.  There are two bars&mdash;one on each side&mdash;that I
needed to attach to the frame, but I only attached one.  As such, when
I went for my run, the other one poked through the mesh and into my back.
I realized what I had done so I turned around and ran (much more
slowly) home to fix it.  I then decided to call it a day because I
still have a tender left hamstring from _before_ Tucson and I haven't
fully recovered from Tucson.

FWIW, I ran the first 1/4 mile @ 8:12 min/mile. Last week the same 1/4
mile was @ 6:58 min/mile.  If I had chosen to skip today's run
entirely, I don't think it would have hurt my training, per-se, but
there's a good chance that come Saturday I'd attempt my La Luz run
with only one of the two bars attached and have to abort _that_
training run.  As such, I'm glad I attempted this run and am not too
disappointed that I chose to turn back.
