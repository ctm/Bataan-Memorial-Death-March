[^1]: On December 13th, I only ran 0.49 miles, because my pack
started poking me in the back one quarter mile in.  This was a new
pack that I bought to replace my previous one which had torn due to
the stress I've put on it over the last couple of years.

[^2]: Normally there is also skiing and snowshoeing, but there wasn't
enough snow to do that this year.  I did, however, carry my snowshoes
in a backpack with me from the run/ski transition.  I also held myself
back because I had the Ghost Town 50k the next day.

## Prediction going into BMDM 2018

### Fitness

I am better trained than last year, but not as trained as 2016.

### Weather

BMDM in 2016 was on March 20th.  This year it's March 25th.  Those
five days are probably going to add to the heat.  Although it probably
won't be as hot as it was last year (which was the hottest it's ever
been since they moved the event from April back to March), the current
prediction is for a low of 54 and high of 79.  That's fairly hot.

### Other differences

Last year I switched from an external frame backpack to an internal one,
because internal frames are better for search and rescue.  I figured I
should use an internal frame for SAR and it makes sense to train for BMDM
with the same pack I use for SAR.  That was a bad choice and the extra
heat really got to me.  So this year I'm back to using an external frame
for BMDM but I still use my internal frame for SAR.

Psychologically, I'm more resilient than I was last year.  Mentally I
simply wasn't over my bike accident last year.  This year it's a
distant memory (although I did use my bike's brakes when I got up to
45mph going downhill @ The Quad this year).

Last year I used an iPod nano; this year I'm using my iPhone.  I will
try hard to keep water out of my earbuds.  Last year my tunes started
fritzing out at around mile 20.  This year I'm hoping for my playlist
to last throughout the race.

### 4:45

At the beginning of this year's training, my goal was to break 4:30.
However, to have maximized my chance of doing so, I shouldn't have run
Tucson to qualify for Boston, I shouldn't have done the Quad and Ghost
Town 50k in the same weekend, I shouldn't have done a Team RWB hike on
March 10th, nor should I have had a couple beers on Tuesday March 20th
before my last Wednesday pack run, but ... I'm glad I did all of those
things.

If the weather isn't too bad, I think I can easily break 4:45.  I will
still try to break 4:30, but my big goal is to not let my heart-rate
sag too much between miles 20 and 25.  That has been my downfall.  In
2016 my average HR for that stretch was 151.  In 2017 it was 146 (in
the ferocious heat).  My A goal will be to keep it at 160, but
realistically I may have a hard time keeping it up at 155; because by
that time of the race I'm a bit uncomfortable.

My completely unrealistic goal will be not to cry when I see [Ben
Skardon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGAV5vdRscY).

## Reality of BMDM 2018

I ran
[5:08:10](http://www.itsyourrace.com/Results/6574/2018/68705/5201).
My limiting factor was back discomfort that I've never had before.  I
suspect a few things contributed to it.

I stopped doing core exercises (normally I do a combination of
sit-ups, push-ups and squats on every even calendar day) when I got
sick after the quad/ghosttown weekend.  After that sickness I tried to
get back into shape as quickly as possible and I figured I was close
to the edge as it was and by not doing core I'd be giving the rest of
my body (i.e., my legs) a chance to recover.

There was confusion about the start.  There was supposed to be a
runner's corral for anyone (including civilian heavy) planning on
running.  However, there was no such corral, nor did anyone seem to
know what runners were supposed to do.  I was asking an official and
someone in the civilian light corral said that this is where you
should be.  I asked if he was sure and his reply was something like
"this is the fastest group".  That was sufficient to convince me, so
that's where I stayed.

Unbeknownst to me, however, room was made in the Honorary corral for
runners, who were indeed let loose just after the Wounded Warriors.
Unlike previous years, there were actual marshals _preventing_ people
from leaving the other corrals until it was their time.  I did not
understand what was happening, so I wore my pack standing still for a
half hour.

To make matters worse, even though I knew there was a new exit
pattern, I assumed that we'd go past the porta-potties before we
crossed the timing barrier for the start, so I wasn't that concerned
when I didn't get one final potty stop before the opening ceremonies.
When the start didn't pass the porta-potties, I wasn't concerned, but
I should have been.

At mile 8, I saw there was a free porta-potty.  I figured I could get
in and out real quick since all I needed to do&mdash;I
thought&mdash;was to take a leak.  However, once I was doing my
business I realized I was mistaken and I had to sit down.  Getting the
pack off and back on again afterward _inside_ the porta-potty was
trickier than I thought.  In fact, I wrapped my chest strap around my
shoulder strap and didn't realize it.

For the next hour or so something didn't feel right, but although I
checked to make sure my center strap was buckled and at the correct
height, I didn't notice that it was wrapped around the shoulder strap.
At about mile 13 I realized and corrected my error.

All of the above trivia gives me plenty of room for improvement in
2019.  I mention it mostly to remind myself of the various things I
need to do to improve, but clearly the biggest is I need to stay
healthy and uninjured.  As such, I've significantly cut back on my
celebratory drinking. Furthermore, when I start doing La Luz pack runs
again, I'll be happy to lose a few minutes due to being overly
cautious than to take another spill with my pack.  OTOH, six days
after BMDM 2018, I was running down Pino trail (without a pack!) and I
rolled my ankle pretty bad.

Oh, and even if I had gone out with the runners at the beginning, that
may have been worse, because a lot of the early runners went the wrong
direction and had to turn around.  That was extra energy and extra
mental toil.

The reason the start was different this year was to accommodate more
participants, which they did and which is awesome.  More great news
is that White Sands Missile Range has put up a [bunch of
videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDXRhCI1BcHX9lJDc2Marqg/videos)
of excerpts from the talks the vets gave, including:

As well as the [Congressional Gold Medal

For those of you who didn't make it out this year, there were seven
vets present: the four mentioned above as well as [Ocar

Herrera, and [James Bolich](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0HD6eEcViU).
