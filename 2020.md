It's too early to set up my training schedule for 2020, but I'm
logging my body fat percentages, ruck runs and races.

|Test Date|Body Weight|Fat Weight|Fat Free Weight|Body Fat %|
|---------|-----------|----------|---------------|----------|
|2018-03-29|185.5|40.7|144.8|21.95|
|2018-06-04|159.6|23.3|136.3|14.61|
|2018-07-26|151.4|14.7|136.7|9.74|
|2018-11-08|152.6|14.0|138.6|9.15|
|2019-04-05|156.5|19.4|137.1|12.41|

While I was doing my serious training for BMDM 2019, I deliberately
let my weight creep up as long as my performance was increasing.  I
was assuming that some of my weight gain was muscle mass, but I wasn't
taking the time to go down to UNM and check.  It looks like I was
wrong, so I do not plan on letting my weight creep up for 2020.

One thing about my 2019-04-05 hydrostatic weighing is that I did it in
the morning after fasting the entire night and doing a 6.56 mile ruck
run, whereas 2018-11-08 was a Thursday afternoon weighing with only a
four hour fast.  I am going to go back to Thursday afternoon weighings
in the future and although I was planning on not going more than a
month before my next one, life got in the way.

So, comparing my 2019-04-05 stats to 2018-03-29, I'm pretty happy with
the progress I've made in a year. However, when comparing to
2018-11-08, I'm disappointed, although there's plenty of room for
improvement.

My April 5th run was using George's Goruck pack with the 30 pound
plate in it. When I weighed it, I got 32.5 pounds.  I normally train
with 40 pounds, but today I was more concerned with testing the pack
than training, per-se.  My lower back is *still* not completely
recovered from BMDM.

My May 8th run was with a Kelty Trekker that I bought back when I
couldn't find a Tioga to replace the first Tioga I had.  I used it
once and didn't like it. The dislike encouraged me to try searching
harder, which I did, and I found a Tioga.  However, since I have the
Believe in Heroes ruck 5k coming up, I figured I'd give my Trekker a
try again.  This time I took a couple barbells and a lifting plate,
wrapped them in a towel and used that.  Unfortunately everything
shifted to one side and one of the stays got significantly bent.  This
put a fair amount of strain on my back, but I was OK for Elevation
Insanity on Saturday (although the weather, construction and our slow
turnaround times led to us only doing 5 ascents, rather than 6).

Between May 8th and when I taper for Hardrock, most of my weeks have
me doing 15.5 miles Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, with Mondays
including interval training.  Starting May 8th, Wednesdays _should_ be
40# pack runs.  Fridays will just be 130bpm "normal" runs.  Tuesdays
and Thursdays will be 8.9 mile 130bpm and typically I'll have a big
event on Saturday and ride my bike on Sunday.

In reality, between the Trekker being ill-suited to pack training and
my various races, I've not done many 15.5 mile 40# Wednesdays.

Oh, and Winning Coffee closed down, so we're no longer holding Cocoa
Conspiracy there on Thursday mornings, which means it's impossible for
me to *completely* replicate my sleeping and eating pattern leading up
to my 2018-11-08 hydrostatic weighing. That too has contributed to me
not getting a weighing done recently.
