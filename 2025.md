# 2025 Bataan Memorial Death March Training Log

I do this every year.  There's more info in [the top-level
README.md](README.md) (although some of it may be outdated, due to the
change in my training for 2025).  My goal for 2025 is to be competitive
at the [Bataan Memorial Death March](https://bataanmarch.com/) and to
continue inspiring others.

### Warm Start

Normally I do a little rucking throughout the year to maintain my ruck
fitness.  However, my&mdash;then ninety-one year old&mdash;mom had a
stroke on March 27th, 2024, less than two weeks after BMDM and since
then my running and training has been greatly reduced. I did, however
do a lot of "time on my feet", where I loaded my ruck up with eighty
pounds and then did "housework" for a couple hours many times a week,
although even that stopped toward the end of my "fun around"
block. So, I am going into my 2025 training block _probably_ in
slightly better ruck shape than I did for [2024](2024.md).

### Non-ruck exercise

Due to my mom's condition, I am starting my 2025 training block very
differently from what I've done before.  I will try to do each of my
ruck trainings listed below, but on non-ruck days, I may not do any
cardio at all, since I'll be walking with my mom and there are only
so many hours in the day.

For now, my plan is to drive from mom's house to my house every
Wednesday morning for my ruck speed run.  That's close to an hour of
driving, but I believe the training effect is worth it.

### Troublesome right foot

My right foot continues to give me trouble, but I'm learning to work
around it.

[^1]: There was no ruck division, but I ran with my ruck anyway.
[^2]: I let myself get sick by running the [Tortugas Mountain 24-hour Challenge](https://ultrasignup.com/results_event.aspx?did=117023),
winning the drinking division, when I was fighting off a cold.  The following weekend
was the [White Mesa Fat Ass 50k](https://newmexicofa50k.wordpress.com/white_mesa_50k), which I also "ran", even though by then I had
junk in my lungs. Unsurprisingly, two days later my lungs still
hadn't cleared out. [I blame society](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3b5Q7b8YXo).
[^3]: On Wednesday, November 20th, my mom had a raspy voice and wasn't feeling
well enough to go walking. She felt worse each day after and took a covid test
on Friday, the 22nd. It was positive. She most likely caught covid from me and
at least some of the junk in my lungs was due to covid.  I still
have some symptoms, but were it not for my mom, I'd be up hiking&mdash;if not
running&mdash;La Luz on the 23rd, but I told her I'd let her sleep in until
7:30am (she normally is awoken every morning at 6:00am).
