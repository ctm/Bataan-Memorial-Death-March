# Bataan Memorial Death March training

Cliff Matthews's training plan for the 2019 [Bataan
Memorial Death March](http://bataanmarch.com) (civilian heavy),
similar to what I did for [2017](2017.md) and [2018](2018.md).

## What is the BMDM?

The Bataan Memorial Death March is a tribute to the men and women who
defended the Philippines at the onset of World War II.  They suffered
greatly and many perished either during the defense, after they were
surrendered and were forced to march (having subsisted on quarter
rations prior to the start of the march), at the inhumane prison
camps, the hell-ships that carried them to Japan or in the forced
labor thereafter.

Some of those men and women, now in their nineties, are still alive.  In
1989, members of the Army ROTC Department at New Mexico State University
started an annual march to honor these veterans.  The march has grown
considerably since then and although it was initially open only to
military members, it was open to civilians early on.  These days,
participation is about half and half.

## Why do I do it?

I attended my first BMDM in 2010.  I knew that in principle it was a
good cause, but it wasn't until I heard the vets tell their histories
that I was hooked.

Although that first march took me seven and a half hours and beat the
hell out of me, I decided to return each year as long as the original
vets were still coming out.  I also decided to volunteer for search
and rescue (SAR) since I realized I met the physical requirements and
knew that SAR was a tiny way I could say thanks with more than a word
and a handshake.

In addition to honoring veterans, training for BMDM keeps me fit for
SAR missions.

## How do I train?

I was totally unprepared my first year.  I did only four practice
hikes, each with a 35 pound pack, each with an increasing distance.
My hikes were in sandy terrain, because I had read about the sand
pits, and I wore hiking boots.  That was not a heavy enough pack to
train with; that wasn't enough training days, and the surface was too
soft.  So, when I attended my first BMDM, my feet hurt quite a bit by
mile six.  I could barely walk the last several miles.

Somewhere around 2014, I started training in November. Then, in 2017,
I started doing weekly pack runs in late August.  From 2014 until last
yer, In my non-training months I tried to do _something_ with my pack
at least once a month between BMDM and whenever I started my weekly
pack runs. Often that was a search and rescue mission or two, but when
we got dry spells and no missions for a month I did something like a
big hike with a fifty pound pack.

Since 2014, I've been ramping up my training starting in November.
Until this year, I'd run with my pack on Wednesdays and on Saturdays.
This year I'm doing that but also running with my pack on Mondays. My
Wednesday runs are done as quickly as I can and start from and end at
my house.  Typically I increase the distance by a half mile each week.
My Saturday runs alternate between a level run at race pace and a run
five miles up and five miles down La Luz Trail (i.e., the local
mountain).  My level run distance typically increases by three miles.
My mountain run stays the same distance, but I try to do it faster
each time.  My Monday run is always 13.1 miles, but incorporates
12 75 second all-out intervals in the middle.

In addition to my pack runs, I also run without my pack the remaining
days of the week except Sunday, when I ride my bike.

## Is this training plan safe?

No.  If you run with a pack, you risk injury.  I have worked up to
this training plan over several years.  A plan of doing two pack runs
a week with running and cycling in between is probably doable for
anyone who has already run a marathon or two, although the times,
distances and weight should probably be lessened.  Three pack runs a
week is probably a bad idea for almost everyone.

## Base building

In previous years, my BMDM training has begun in mid November.  I was
not happy with my performance @ BMDM in March of 2017, so that year I
started doing Wednesday pack runs in late August.  I also stopped
tapering and taking recovery days after my August through November
races.

I did fine without the taper or recovery days for all of my races
until the Tucson marathon.  I caught a pretty bad cold (or maybe it
was the flu) a week after Tucson that I _may_ have avoided had I
either spent a little time recovering or not done as much celebratory
drinking.  On the other hand, my son had caught the same bug before I
did and my wife caught it shortly after.  Friends and relatives caught
it around the same time, so maybe I'd have fallen sick regardless.

## Weight loss

On March 29th, 2018 I went down to UNM and was hydrostatically weighed.  My
body fat percentage was 21.95%.  That was a wake-up call, so I decided
to experiment with losing weight and trying to not lose power.  I was
a little nervous that doing so would interfere with my ability to finish
Cruel Jewel 100, but it was just the opposite.  I finished CJ100 much
quicker than I expected, in part&mdash;I believe&mdash;due to my weight loss.

My goal was to get my body fat percentage down to 7.3%.  Based on my
first hydrostatic weighing, that would have been approximately 156
pounds, except I had a second hydrostatic weighing on June 4th.  I
weighed 159.6, which was a 25.9 pound loss, but 8.5 of that was lean
muscle mass.

After that weighing, I raised the number of calories and the amount of
protein I was taking during some of my more lengthy runs.  The change
was successful.  I had my third weighing on July 26th and I lost 8.6
pounds of fat and gained .4 pounds of muscle.  Similarly, I had
my fourth on November 8th and lost only .7 pounds of fat, but gained
1.9 pounds of muscle.

|Test Date|Body Weight|Fat Weight|Fat Free Weight|Body Fat %|
|---------|-----------|----------|---------------|----------|
|2018-03-29|185.5|40.7|144.8|21.95|
|2018-06-04|159.6|23.3|136.3|14.61|
|2018-07-26|151.4|14.7|136.7|9.74|
|2018-11-08|152.6|14.0|138.6|9.15|

Even though I didn't hit 7.3%, I've ramped up my carbohydrate intake
and increased the intensity of some of my training days.  I'm still doing
some of my diet protocol and expect to stabilize at near 7.3% by mid
December.

## Non-pack Days

During the week I do slow runs from my house out to Albuquerque Academy,
some distance around Albuquerque Academy and back to my house.  On Sundays
I ride my bike along the Bosque Bike trail.  How far I ride is dependent
on weather, mood, how much time I want to be out and to a lesser extent
how beat up I am from my Saturday activity. I usually ride my bike between 35 and 50
miles the day after a La Luz pack run and 35 miles the day after a Bosque
Bike Path pack run.

On Mondays I run from my house to Albuquerque Academy, run three laps
around AA, back to my house and then do another .9 miles to bring the
total up to 13.1 miles. However, during that half marathon, I do twelve
all-outs of seventy-five seconds with only thirty seconds of rest in
between.

In theory, I try to keep my heart-rate at about 130bpm for my slow
runs and bike ride, but if it's chilly or I'm rushed or otherwise
feeling frisky I may run, or bike, a bit faster.

This is what I did up until BMDM 2018

|Day|Activity|Amount|
|---|--------|------|
|Sunday|Bike Ride|35 - 70 miles|
|Monday|Interval Training|8.9 miles|
|Tuesday|Slow Run|3 miles|
|Thursday|Slow Run|5.6 miles|
|Friday|Slow Run| 3 miles|

Starting in April 2018, I upped my schedule to:

|Day|Activity|Amount|
|---|--------|------|
|Sunday|Bike Ride|35 - 70 miles|
|Monday|Interval Training|13.1 miles|
|Tuesday|Slow Run|8.9 miles|
|Thursday|Slow Run|8.9 miles|
|Friday|Slow Run|13.1 miles|

On November 19th, 2018, I started doing my interval training with
my pack, so Monday is no longer a non-pack day.

Starting Friday, January 11th, I've decided to take Fridays completely
off from running so I can run harder on Saturdays.

## Pack (and exception) days

In the following table, `speed` means as quickly as I can to minimize
the total time I spend. This year it should be about a 9:30
minute/mile pace when running with my pack.  My speed during my
non-pack races (e.g., Sandia Snowshoe Race and the Mt. Taylor Winter
Quadrathlon) varies greatly.

`Race` is my race goal of 10:18 minute/mile.

`Mountain` means I'm running
up and down a mountain and trying to minimize my time.  I run the same
mountain course every other weekend.  As my fitness increases, so does
my pace.  My record, in February 2016, was a 14:15 minute/mile pace.  I
should be able to better this year.

`Comfort` means I'll
keep my HR between below 150bpm during the training or event.
I'm out there to have fun.

`Interval` Beginning Novemver 19th, I began doing interval training with my
forty pound pack, wrapped with enough low heart rate running on either end
to be a total of 13.1 miles with an average heart rate of 130bpm.  The
intervals themselves are 12 all-outs of 75 seconds each, with 30 seconds
of light runnning as rest in between.

Prior to Novemver 19th, I had done interval trainings on Monday, but
without the pack.

`Pace` meant whatever it took to be the best pacer possible for my
brother-in-law as he finished his first Leadville 100.  Turns out
the little bugger was plagued with GI trouble that slowed him down
for much of the return from Winfield, then&mdash;after that
subsided&mdash;he wanted to run the final
seven or eight miles. Fun!

When I run from my house, I typically run over to Albuquerque Academy,
then run around it some distance before coming back.  As such, I
typically have to wait at a stoplight a couple of times or more and
it's hillier than the Bosque Bike path, which has neither stops nor
hills.


## My plan

In addition to the runs in the following table, I may do others.  My
[Marathon
Maniacs](http://www.marathonmaniacsdb.com/Maniacs/MyRaces?ManiacId=4395)
and
[UltraSignup](http://ultrasignup.com/results_participant.aspx?fname=Clifford&lname=Matthews)
pages should list anything major.

### Wednesday pack runs

I sprained my ankle six days after BMDM, so I didn't do another pack
run until Thursday, April 26th, when I chose to run 8.9 miles at about
a 130bpm heart rate with a 31.5# pack as part of a plan to slowly get
back into running on Wednesdays with a 40# pack.

I've logged _all_ my pack runs (and some other activities) since then,
and built a formidable base.  On November 14th I started my _serious_ training.

### Upcoming (includes non-ruck endurance events and races)
#### Does not include Mondays, which are all 13.1 mi, 40#, w/intervals (see above)

I may do my second 24 mile Bosque Bike Path run on Friday, February
22nd rather than Saturday, February 23rd (it'll probably come down to
whether it interferes with work) so that I'll be able to run the V Day
Run w/o getting up ridiculously early.  OTOH, that's only 6 days after
the Mt. Taylor Quadrathlon, so there's a chance I'll still be
recovering from that.
