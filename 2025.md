# 2025 Bataan Memorial Death March Training Log

I do this every year.  There's more info in [the top-level
README.md](README.md) (although some of it may be outdated, due to the
change in my training for 2025).  My goal for 2025 is to be competitive
at the [Bataan Memorial Death March](https://bataanmarch.com/) and to
continue inspiring others.

### Warm Start

Normally I do a little rucking throughout the year to maintain my ruck
fitness.  However, my&mdash;then ninety-one year old&mdash;mom had a
stroke on March 27th, 2024, less than two weeks after BMDM and since
then my running and training has been greatly reduced. I did, however
do a lot of "time on my feet", where I loaded my ruck up with eighty
pounds and then did "housework" for a couple hours many times a week,
although even that stopped toward the end of my "fun around"
block. So, I am going into my 2025 training block _probably_ in
slightly better ruck shape than I did for [2024](2024.md).

### Non-ruck exercise

Due to my mom's condition, I am starting my 2025 training block very
differently from what I've done before.  I will try to do each of my
ruck trainings listed below, but on non-ruck days, I may not do any
cardio at all, since I'll be walking with my mom and there are only
so many hours in the day.

For now, my plan is to drive from mom's house to my house every
Wednesday morning for my ruck speed run.  That's close to an hour of
driving, but I believe the training effect is worth it.

I'm also experimenting with tossing extra weight into my pack when I
walk with mom and potentially keeping it on a little longer than just
her loop to give me some "time on my feet" (`tomf`).

### Troublesome right foot

My right foot continues to give me trouble, but I'm learning to work
around it.

[^1]: There was no ruck division, but I ran with my ruck anyway.
[^2]: I let myself get sick by running the [Tortugas Mountain 24-hour Challenge](https://ultrasignup.com/results_event.aspx?did=117023),
winning the drinking division, when I was fighting off a cold.  The following weekend
was the [White Mesa Fat Ass 50k](https://newmexicofa50k.wordpress.com/white_mesa_50k), which I also "ran", even though by then I had
junk in my lungs. Unsurprisingly, two days later my lungs still
hadn't cleared out. [I blame society](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3b5Q7b8YXo).
[^3]: On Wednesday, November 20th, my mom had a raspy voice and wasn't feeling
well enough to go walking. She felt worse each day after and took a covid test
on Friday, the 22nd. It was positive. She most likely caught covid from me and
at least some of the junk in my lungs was due to covid.  I still
have some symptoms, but were it not for my mom, I'd be up hiking&mdash;if not
running&mdash;La Luz on the 23rd, but I told her I'd let her sleep in until
7:30am (she normally is awoken every morning at 6:00am).
[^4]: Iris's flight got in at 10:25 and was running on time, so I wouldn't
have been able to run with others, even had I been invited. I'd also have
had to leave for the airport before the others would be festively drinking
and additionally, my mom is still recovering from covid, so I didn't even
ask about this "event" this year.
[^5]: I should have done pack intervals today, but I was too lazy.  I did,
however, don my pack for a loop with mom, but I even botched that by not
starting my GPS watch on time.  Oh well.
[^6]: Sorry for the Facebook link, but the [Los Lunas link](https://www.loslunasnm.gov/721/King-of-the-Hill) is currently broken.
[^7]: I chose to put my pack on while I was still futzing around
inside. I figured that would give me more time on my feet, but I
didn't think about the fact that it would totally scrog my pace.
[^8]: I went to bed on Thursday the 19th, thinking I'd be running this on
Saturday the 21st, but changed my mind.  I figured it made sense to do it
on Friday the 20th so that I'd still have the caffeine in my system to help
me stay up late to pick up Iris.  I made a bunch of mistakes and I do not
think I got as good of a training effect from this "run" as I would have had
I planned a little better.  Live and learn. My Strava description has a lot
more detail, but even that leaves out some info, like why I was taking ibuprofen
in the first place (mostly due to starting out with a blister, which might
be related to all the TOMF).
[^9]: This was to have been pack intervals, but my back is slightly
scabbed over from doing three pack runs a week and doing my eighteen
miler w/o spending enough time double-checking item placement within
the pack and strap adjustment.  FTR, I've never been able to do three pack
runs a week w/o too much chafing.  I was hoping I could get away with it
this training block because I'm not running much at all on my non-pack days,
and hence I'd rather get more pack training rather than less, but it's not
looking promising.
[^10]: Made you look. I wound up with a financial hiccup large enough to
interfere with my sleep for over a week straight. I didn't get it
resolved until Sunday afternoon and by then it was too late for me to
realistically do a La Luz pack run, especially with the big scab on my
back from Wednesday's chafing. Unfortunately, even with the financial
crisis avoided, I still didn't sleep well Sunday night, presumably because
I haven't been getting enough cardio to make me tired enough. D'oh!
[^11]: It was 18F when I pulled into the 8808 driveway, but I didn't get out
the door for another hour and twelve minutes and the temperature was rising.
[^12]: I chose to make a big block of time so I could get substantial work
done on my PokerStars hand history parser. I had planned on doing the intervals
anyway, but I had forgotten to prepare Fuzzle's chicken and once I took the
time to do that, I was already ensconced in programming. C'est la vie.
[^13]: I forgot my sports watch, which is why I ran at a leisurely pace. My
heart-rate and the temperature are both educated guesses.  I could have looked
up the temperature, but it was well above freezing.
[^14]: This was scheduled for Saturday, February 1st, but I was pretty sick
on Friday, January 31st, so I wound up putting this off a day and then doing
it more as a hike than a run. It was kind of annoying, but still great to get
some time on the mountain.
[^15]: Mom needed to see a doctor as part of the process to investigate getting
additional care. I could have*mdash;and perhaps _should_ have*mdash;done my
ruck run before the appointment, but I didn't want to be all wired for the
appointment, nor did I want to risk falling (which I haven't done during a
Wednesday speed run this year, I don't think).  Family comes first.
[^16]: Should have been twelve miles, but I was still sick, which is why my
heart-rate was so high for such a slow pace.
[^17]: [Run and Snowshow](https://www.strava.com/activities/13642243375) and
[Bike Down](https://www.strava.com/activities/13642242707).  I didn't remember
how to do multi-sport, but there was no skiing this year, so my plan was to
do each of the sports separately, but I had too much trouble getting my
snowshoes on and I wound up forgetting to switch from run to snowshoe.  I
_might_ go back and hand-edit the Run, Snowshoe, Run into three segments, but
I haven't yet. The heart-rate I've listed is the weighted by duration sum all
three Strava activities.
[^18]: The van thermometer said 36F at 8:13, but I didn't start running until
9:36, so I'm guessing about a four degree rise.
