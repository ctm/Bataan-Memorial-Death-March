# 2024 Bataan Memorial Death March Training Log

I do this every year.  There's more info in [the top-level
README.md](README.md).  My goal for 2024 is to be competitive at the
[Bataan Memorial Death March](https://bataanmarch.com/) and maybe the
[Tough Ruck](https://www.toughruck.org/).


### Cold Start

Normally I do a little rucking throughout the year to maintain my ruck
fitness.  I had a lot of trouble with my right foot during training
for BMDM 2023 and yet I continued to do many long distance events,
including the Cocodona 250, Jemez Mountain Trail 50 miler and the
Western States Endurance Run.  After that, I took time off and didn't
run at all, much less ruck. Additionally, on July 1st I fell and
probably cracked a rib and that too prevented me from rucking.

So, although I [raced the Tatonka
5k](https://ctm.github.io/docs/yld/running/past/2023/tatonka_5k.html)
with my ruck, I started my BMDM training in the worst shape
I've been in for years. Oh well.

### Sunday is cycling day

The following tables include all my planned rucks as well the named
non-rucking events I do during this training block.  I add those since
I schedule my rucking around them.  I don't list all the other
non-ruck running I do, but in general&mdash;at least in
theory&mdash;I'll be running six days a week and riding my unicycle[^9] or
bicycle on Sunday

### Future

I try to keep this plan current, both by moving finished trainings
into the Past table and also by changing my plans to meet changing
circumstances (injuries, sickness, higher priority items).

<hr/>

[^9]: I had hoped to enter the lottery for the [White Mountains
100](https://wm100.endurancenorth.org/) for 2024, but my finances did not
permit that. I am still training on my unicycle with an eye toward 2025.
[^1]: There was no ruck division, but I ran with my ruck anyway.
[^2]: This was **not** comfortable. Having run the Javelina Jundred on Saturday,
this was an experiment to see what six miles with a forty pound pack would
feel like. I figured I could always slow down and/or turn around early if
it was too uncomfortable.  Well, a little bit past the turnaround point it
was indeed "too" uncomfortable, but I still had to get home. D'oh!
[^3]: This **was** comfortable. I think I've got my right foot issue corrected.
I'll know for sure on December 2nd, when I do a 15 miler 40# ruck run at
race pace.
[^4]: I chose to run this event with my pack just to get a little extra training.
[^5]: GI distress caused me to turn around early and run toward the
toilet at home. Eventually I had to slow to a walk, so I've split
today's run into two portions: running and walking.
[^6]: I added this pack run to make up for my missing pack mileage from my
aborted speed run. I chose to do this at a 130bpm HR though because I have an
actual (non-pack) race later in the day.
[^7]: I'm doing a leisurely 5k ruck run on Sundays as part of the
    [Black Friday to White Christmas 5k
    Challenge](https://www.facebook.com/events/981971503034313)
[^8]: Initially I had penned in the [Tucson
Marathon](https://www.tucsonmarathon.com/) for today's training, but I
couldn't afford the time off from work for the drive there and back
and I was also having some knee and foot discomfort, so I chose to do
a mountain run instead. However, it was colder at the start than I had
prepared for and wound up wearing my puffy jacket without my ice hat
which, combined with the old rutted, yet frozen, snow caused me to go
ridiculously slowly.
[^10]: The scab on my back needed additional time to heal, and I also
wanted to run the [southern half of the Foothils 50k
course](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/map/foothills-fat-ass-50k-southern-section-5c3b99e)
to capture a clean GPX file.
[^11]: Today's conditions were treacherous. I chose to turn back at the overlook, even though I could have proceeded a little further before I would have hit the snowdrift that I shouldn't cross. As it is, I post-holed to just below my knees on the way up and below my knees on the way down.
[^12]: I was not feeling well, but I still got my pack ready, filled my handhelds, even "taped" my back, but then&mdash;at the last minute&mdash;chose to skip this training in part due to the GI distress that was accompanying my body aches, headache, congestion and stuff in my lungs. It was a tough call and I'm not convinced I made the right choice, but I'll never know.
